      "Article 1\n",
      "Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the last budget of the NDA 2 government on Thursday. The budget was an interim one, intended to ensure continuity till a new government takes charge after the Lok Sabha elections, scheduled to be held in April-May later this year.\n",
      "While no big announcements are usually made in interim budgets, the previous Narendra Modi government, with Piyush Goyal as Finance Minister, bucked the trend and made two big announcements. Firstly, the government announced the inception of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), which promised an annual benefit of Rs 6,000 to all farmers owning up to two hectares of land. The then government also announced a monthly pension of Rs 3,000 for workers above the age of 60 in the unorganised sector under the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan (PM-SYM).\n",
      "While an outlay of Rs 75,000 crore was given to the PM-KISAN scheme, the PM-SYM was a contributory scheme, where the worker and the government would contribute equally on the lines of provident fund.\n",
      "Goyal also made a major announcement on income tax as individuals with an annual taxable income not exceeding Rs 5 lakh were set to receive a full tax rebate of Rs 12,500.\n",
      "In 2014, which was the last budget of the UPA government and was presented by then Finance Minister P Chidambaram, saw allocation for defence being hiked 10% to the previous year and the in-principle approval of the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme. An outlay of Rs 11,009 crore was also provided for the modernisation plan of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs).\n",
      "Interestingly, the Congress-led Opposition, which is a vocal critic of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), in the 2014 interim budget had urged all political parties to pass the GST laws and the Direct Tax Code of 2014-2015. The UPA government also made some minor changes to the indirect tax rates and exempted blood banks from taxes.\n",

      "In the video message to the people of Jharkhand, Soren said he didn’t have much time and would continue his fight. He hoped he would be in the hearts of every person in the state and also underlined he had full faith in the judiciary. “Recently, Bihar fell prey to political conspiracy. Now they want to make Jharkhand the second victim of political conspiracy,” said the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader.\n",

Today a popular government, an Adivasi-led government, was working hard to serve the people … it appears that this time is getting over. We have to get into a new fight against the feudalistic mindset and the systems which oppress the poor, the Adivasi. We will make it stronger and we will struggle for them,” he said.\n",

      "Article 3\n",
      "How the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi mosque title suit is settled may come down to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991. Sections 3 and 4 of the Act essentially declare that the religious character of a place of worship, barring the then-contested Rajanmabhoomi in Ayodhya, will continue to be the same as on August 15, 1947, and that no person shall convert any place of worship of any religious denomination into one of a different denomination or section.\n",
      "The Supreme Court is in the process of hearing whether the 1991 Act bars even the filing of such a plea regarding any other place of worship. So far, only oral observations have been submitted, with the Court yet to conclusively rule on the issue.\n",
      "The 1991 Act had been brought in by the then Congress government of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao at a time when the Ram temple movement was at its peak. The Babri Masjid was still standing, but L K Advani’s rath yatra, his arrest in Bihar, and the firing on kar sevaks in Uttar Pradesh had raised communal tensions. The Congress argued that the Bill would help prevent future communal clashes.\n",
      "The Bill was introduced in the 1991 Monsoon Session, and saw at least eight hours of debate, marred by frequent interruptions and expunged remarks, with intense opposition from the BJP’s side. Over the course of the debate, spread out over three days, both sides claimed that their position would ensure communal harmony.\n",
      "Ultimately, the Bill was passed without any major amendments and retained the exclusion of Ayodhya and Jammu and Kashmir from its purview. A year later, in December 1992, the Babri Masjid was destroyed by activists of the VHP and other Hindu groups, leading to communal violence across the country. Narasimha Rao was heavily criticised for his government’s handling of the situation, including permitting the BJP-led UP government, which refused to use central paramilitary forces, to oversee security measures.\n",
      "In 2022, Krishna Pal Singh Yadav, the BJP MP from Guna, introduced a private member’s Bill for repeal of the Act. However, it has not yet come up for discussion.\n",
      "A look back at the debate in Parliament over the 1991 Act:\n",
      "Government stand\n",
      "The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha by then Home Minister S B Chavan with the objective of “prohibiting conversion of places of worship and to provide for the maintenance of their religious character as it existed on August 15, 1947”.\n",
      "The Congress had promised to introduce the Bill in its 1991 election manifesto and it was also mentioned in the President’s address to Parliament earlier that year.\n",
      "“It is considered necessary to adopt these measures in view of the controversies arising from time to time with regard to conversion of places of worship, which tend to vitiate the communal atmosphere,” Chavan said after introducing the Bill. “I am sure that enactment of this Bill will go a long way in helping restore communal amity and goodwill.”\n",
      "Near the end of the debate on the Bill, Chavan said, “In recent years, we have noticed with anxiety an alarming rise of intolerance propagated by certain sections for their narrow vested interests. One of the methods… is taking resort to forcible conversion of places of worship to create new disputes and to rake up old controversies… We consider it necessary to take steps to put an immediate end to such unfortunate conflicts and foreclose any new controversies. This Bill… seeks to achieve this objective.”\n",
      "BJP stand\n",
      "The BJP said the Bill fell “outside the legislative competence” of the Lok Sabha. Jaswant Singh, then the BJP MP from Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, who would later become a Union minister under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government that followed, led the debate for the party. Singh argued that the Bill was “violative of the Constitution” since it legislated on an issue reserved for state governments.\n",
      "The state list in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution includes “pilgrimages, other than pilgrimages to places outside India”. Singh’s contention was that “if places of worship are not places of pilgrimage, then what else are they”.\n",
      "Singh also said that since many places of worship were linked to burial and cremation sites, another subject under the state list, the Bill encroached on states’ rights.\n",
      "Jaswant Singh went on to call the Bill violative of the fundamental right to religion, citing sections of the Constitution that say every religious denomination or section has the right “to own and acquire movable and immovable property” and “to administer such property in accordance with law”.\n",
      "“I think we are somewhere impinging on this fundamental right. It is of course a Constitutional question and you will ask me to explain whether a Constitutional question can be raised, but I consider it prudent to raise this now and here,” Singh said.\n",
      "The BJP also opposed the exclusion of J&K from the Bill. “I believe that with the exclusion of Jammu and Kashmir, where it is well enough known that a great many temples have been desecrated, would it not be violative of basic and fundamental equity and the Constitution?” Singh said.\n",
      "Many of Singh’s BJP colleagues were more hostile in their criticism of the Bill. BJP MP Ram Naik, from Bombay North, who went on to become a Union minister under Vajpayee, called it the “blackest Bill in Indian Parliament”. “This Bill proposes to legalise all encroachments upon Hindu temples made during Mughal and British rule,” he said.\n",
      "Advani, who led the rath yatra, was at the time the Leader of the Opposition, and would go on to be an accused in the Babri Masjid case (later acquitted), only briefly expressed his opposition to the Bill before staging a walk-out. “I believe that this Bill is thoroughly ill-conceived. The Bill is totally unwarranted… We cannot associate ourselves with this Bill. We are opposing its introduction,” he said.\n",
      "Uma Bharti, a firebrand BJP MP from Khajuraho who would also be later among the acquitted accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, cited a sub-clause in the Bill that said that any existing legal disputes on the conversion of religious sites would cease after the enactment of the law, to claim that the dispute over the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi would be settled outside the courts.\n",
      "“I am very glad that though the Congress government might not agree with us on various issues, yet it appears that it… has accepted our view that issues of faith cannot be decided in courts. I would be thankful to the government that Ayodhya has been excluded from the purview of this Bill. All this shows that the government does not want confrontation and we also do not want confrontation, although we are not afraid of any confrontation,” Bharti said.\n",
      "Bharti suggested that the Bill would encourage communal violence. “I heard in childhood that pigeons fear the presence of cats. Pigeons are so innocent that they believe the mere closing of eyes will prove to be an effective shield against cats. But this is not correct. Maintenance of the status quo as in 1947, in respect of religious places, is like closing eyes like pigeons against the advancement of cats. This maintenance of the status quo of 1947 will mean preservation of tension for the coming generations,” she said.\n",
      "Bharti also spoke about a visit to the disputed Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, where she claimed to have seen “remnants of the temple”. “Some sort of current of anger ran through my body. I felt disgraced at the fate of my ancestors… Was not the intention of Aurangzeb behind leaving remnants of a temple at the site of the mosque to keep reminding Hindus of their historical fate and to remind coming generations of Muslims of their past glory and power?… l would like to know from the movers of the Bill, why they want to preserve and protect the wrong done by Aurangzeb… Why are they keeping the bone of contention alive?” she said, adding that the Bill was a form of “appeasement”.\n",
      "Other BJP MPs, including Rajasthan legislator Guman Mal Lodha, said the Bill was unnecessary as other laws already offered the same protections. “There is already a law regarding the trespassing of property… This law is an illusory law and it is full of confusion. It is not going to benefit either Hindu or Muslim,” he said.\n",
      "Congress and other parties\n",
      "P M Sayeed, the Congress’s then Lakshadweep MP, who supported the Bill, asked why the Ayodhya site had been left out of its purview. “I request the Home Minister to clarify why it is kept out of the Bill. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has circulated some series of letters in which they have (raised) not only Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi but also Varanasi, Mathura and Taj Mahal. They want to demolish all these,” he said.\n",
      "The CPI(M)’s Somnath Chatterjee, the then MP from Bengal’s Bolpur, who would later become the Lok Sabha Speaker under the first UPA government, said his party would have preferred the inclusion of the Ayodhya dispute, but they accepted the Bill given that Ayodhya had become a “great emotional issue” that should be solved by “mutual discussion”.\n",
      "He also questioned the BJP resorting to the pilgrimage argument. “After a good deal of searching and burning the midnight oil, they (the BJP) have come to… pilgrimages… So far as pilgrimage is concerned… this Bill does not purport to restrict anybody going to a place of worship,” said Chatterjee, who also cited the dictionary definition of ‘pilgrimage’ in his remarks.\n",
      "Ebrahim Sulaiman Sait, an MP and then national president of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), was stronger in his criticism on this point. “As far as Section 5 of the Bill is concerned, it should be deleted because this keeps Babri Masjid out of the purview of the Bill. I cannot understand why this exception,” Sait said.\n",
      "Hyderabad’s then AIMIM MP Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi and then Union minister of Parliamentary Affairs and J&K Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, however, argued that the Bill would help prevent further politicisation of religious issues.\n",
      "“I would like to ask those who are opposing this Bill as to why this Babri Masjid issue was not raised just after 1947 and why they did not raise the issue in 1977 during the Janata regime when… Vajpayee and Advani (were ministers). Why do they raise this issue now? So one can easily understand that this is not simply an issue for them, rather they want to exploit it for acquiring power,” Owaisi said.\n",
      "“The time has come when through this Bill we can impose some checks on some political parties which adopt religion as a means to win elections… In my opinion, there is no law more effective than this law to maintain the unity and integrity of the country,” Azad said.\n",
      "Digvijaya Singh, who was the Congress’s Rajgarh MP at the time, would later become the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and remains one of the party’s more strident voices against Hindutva, was among those against the exclusion of J&K from the Bill.\n",
      "“I would urge the Home minister to reconsider this decision and not to allow our friends on this side to create a kind of propaganda against this Bill. They would be exploiting this Bill for their own political ends, which is quite obvious, seeing their performance in this House. That is why, I urge the Home minister to… extend it to the state of J&K,” he said.\n",
      "The late Ram Vilas Paswan, who was the Janata Dal MP from Bihar’s Rosera at the time, said the Bill was “better late than never”. “Had the Congress party brought such a legislation earlier, I am certain that… the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute would not have arisen… We have far more important problems before us… This country cannot afford to squabble over trifling issues like mandir or masjid,” he said. Paswan’s party (including both its factions) is now a partner of the BJP.\n",

      "Article 4\n",
      "Presiding officer Anil Masih was at the centre of the drama that unfolded in the Chandigarh mayoral elections on Tuesday. The BJP’s Manoj Sonkar won the close election after 8 votes of the parties on the other side were declared invalid by Masih, prompting the AAP and the Congress, who were contesting together as INDIA bloc partners, to accuse him of tampering with the result.\n",
      "Earlier on January 18, when the elections were originally slated, Masih had suddenly fallen ill, leading to the polls being postponed to January 30. The municipal secretary, Gurinder Sodhi, too had taken leave two days before the January 18 polls allegedly due to back pain.\n",
      "The Congress and AAP have accused Masih of scribbling on the ballot papers to render them invalid.\n",
      "Masih joined the BJP in 2018 and is an active member of the party’s minority wing. He is currently among the nine nominated councillors (they do not have voting rights) in the general house of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation.\n",
      "He was nominated in 2022 apparently as a face to represent the issues of minorities in the House.\n",
      "Sources within the BJP said that Masih, who was close to former BJP president Arun Sood, was one of the contenders for the BJP ticket during the Chandigarh civic polls in December 2021 from Ward No. 13.\n",
      "However, almost after a year, Masih was selected as the nominated councillor in 2022.\n",
      "After being nominated councillor, Masih gained a reputation for keenly participating in issues taken up in the general House of the Chandigarh corporation. But, as a member of the House noted, Masih’s “vocal” and “open” support was mostly to BJP councillors during proceedings.\n",
      "As recently as January 10, Masih was seen sharing the stage as AAP councillor Lakhbir Singh joined the BJP. This too had provoked reactions from the Opposition.\n",
      "Chandigarh Congress president H S Lucky called Masih a “messiah for the BJP” and questioned if he was fit for presiding over the polls when he was an active member of the BJP.\n",
      "“When someone is a hardcore BJP member, do you think he will let his candidate lose? He rigged the elections. If you see how he is behaving, you will find the win was totally orchestrated.”\n",
      "Speaking to The Indian Express, Arun Sood, who also served as Chandigarh mayor earlier, said Masih’s party affiliation had nothing to do with his role as presiding officer.\n",
      "“There are governors and other posts held by people with affiliation to a political party. That does not change anything,” Sood said.\n",

      "Article 5\n",
      "THE COMMUNAL tension over the removal of a religious flag in Mandya district indicates the spread of such incidents to Karnataka’s Old Mysore region, which were earlier more common in the coastal districts of the state.\n",
      "Most of these incidents have occurred in the largely agrarian Mandya district and, to some extent, Kolar, leading to the Congress accusation that the BJP is trying to find a base in the region where caste – and not communal – politics has so far been a dominating factor.\n",
      "The Vokkaliga-dominated region is considered a stronghold of the JD(S), with whom the BJP has tied up for the coming Lok Sabha elections. The BJP has largely had a hold among the rival Lingayat community in the state so far.\n",
      "While in 2019, the BJP appeared to have breached the Old Mysore fort by winning a large number of Lok Sabha seats, in last year’s Assembly polls, the Congress had made huge strides in the region. Its Karnataka president and Deputy Chief Minister K Shivakumar is a Vokkaliga, who is trying to emerge as the tallest leader of the community, ahead of the JD(S) Deve Gowda family.\n",
      "The Congress leaders point to how, leading up to the 2018 Assembly polls, the BJP had mounted a campaign against the then Congress government over deaths of 23 right-wing activists in the coastal belt. Not all deaths qualified as communal, but it had given the BJP enough momentum to sweep the coastal belt and eventually form the government in the state.\n",
      "The spree of recent communal incidents in Mandya can be traced back to the hijab row. While it began from a college in Udupi in coastal Karnataka, its effect was also seen in Mandya, where on February 8, 2022, a second-year B Com student of PES College was confronted by a crowd of young men wearing saffron shawls, who heckled her and shouted religious slogans.\n",
      "In May 2022, Mandya’s Srirangapatna saw right-wing Hindu activists come up with the claim that the town’s historic Masjid-e-Ala was built after demolishing a Hanuman temple. An organisation called the ‘Narendra Modi Vichar Manch’ got involved, demanding that the authorities allow Hindus to offer prayers at the mosque. While the matter rests at that, the issue has been kept alive by Hindu activists.\n",
      "Later that year, in November, plays were staged at many places across the state based on the book Tipu Nijakanasugalu (Real Dreams of Tipu) staged by former Rangayana director and theatre artiste Addanda Cariappa. In the play, Cariappa claims that behind the killing of Mysuru ruler Tipu Sultan in the 1700s were two Vokkaliga chieftains Uri Gowda and Nanje Gowda, rather than the British.\n",
      "This fit into the Hindu right wing’s narrative of Tipu as a “Muslim ruler”, with claims regarding his assassination seen as a bid to appeal to Vokkaliga sentiments.\n",
      "Four months later, in March 2023, ahead of the arrival of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mandya to launch several development projects, including the Bengaluru-Mysuru Expressway, BJP workers even installed ‘Uri Gowda and Dodda Nanje Gowda’ Mahadwara (gate) at the entry point of Mandya city.\n",
      "However, this invited a backlash from prominent JD(S) leaders and Vokkaliga seers, and the gate’s banners were changed to ‘Sri Balagangadharanatha Swamiji Mahadwara’, in memory of the late pontiff of the community.\n",
      "The BJP perhaps did not anticipate that Vokkaliga leaders would take umbrage at the “distorted tale” of Tipu Sultan, seeing it as a suggestion that the community had joined hands with the British to kill the king who remains a local hero.\n",
      "The Vokkaligara Sangha approached the then BJP government to take action against those who had “peddled lies” and “defamed” the community, while the JD(S) – then a BJP rival – accused it of trying to fan communal fires by peddling “a fake narrative”.\n",
      "Following this, the BJP leaders stopped speaking about the issue.\n",
      "The BJP has been at the forefront from the start in the recent Keragodu incident, accusing Chief Minister Siddaramaiah of being “anti-Hindu” while questioning the replacement of a Hanuman flag with the Tricolour on a flagpole at Keragodu village.\n",
      "According to the government, the Sri Gowrishankar Seva Trust, which installed the flagpole and hoisted the flag, was permitted to fly only the national and state flags. The trust had “violated” these conditions by hoisting the Hanuman flag, and hence it had to be brought down, officials said. However, coming under pressure, the government had removed the panchayat development officer of the village for “dereliction of duty”, saying he had “failed to notice the violation and take action”.\n",
      "As the BJP continues to hold statewide protests on the matter, Congress leaders have accused the party of stirring the controversy with an eye on the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.\n",
      "What’s different about the Keragodu incident is that, this time, the JD(S) is on the side of the BJP, helping the party draw the kind of response it has done. JD(S) leader and former CM H D Kumaraswamy even participated in one of the protests sporting a saffron shawl.\n",
      "In contrast, during the Uri Gowda and Nanje Gowda row, Kumaraswamy as well as JD(S) patriarch H D Deve Gowda had opposed the BJP’s claims.\n",
      "The JD(S) appears to be counting on this helping it win back some of the support it lost to the BJP in the recent Assembly elections, reducing it to its lowest tally ever.\n",
      "Among the communal incidents reported in Kolar district was the March 2022 row over a cycle rally organised by BJP MP Tejasvi Surya which saw participants playing provocative songs outside a mosque – perhaps the first such in the area.\n",
      "Recently, ahead of the consecration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, there were reports of some religious banners being torn down at Mulbagal town in the district, leading to tension.\n",

      "Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is all set to present on Thursday the Narendra Modi government 2.0’s last Budget before the Lok Sabha elections, which are round the corner.\n",
      "This will be Sitharaman’s sixth consecutive Budget, although this time it will be an interim Budget also referred to as a vote on account as it seeks Parliament’s nod for a grant in advance to meet the central government’s essential expenditure for the first four months of the new fiscal year beginning April. A new government elected after the Lok Sabha polls will present the full Budget in July.\n",
      "Sitharaman’s Budget speech is likely to showcase the achievements of the Modi government not just over the past year but also over the past decade.\n",
      "The Budget is likely to contain a mix of measures for the economy and electorally significant sections like farmers and women.\n",
      "While the BJP does not face any pressure for populist measures, given its dominance in the heartland as evidenced by its resounding victory in recent Assembly elections in three states, Sitharaman is expected to stick to being fiscally prudent while sprinkling sops on sectors like agriculture and engines of the economy that would create jobs and boost consumption. The Budget is expected to focus on infrastructure.\n",
      "While going by the precedence no major policy announcements are made in a vote on accounts, it has not stopped the incumbent government from making big announcements, like the cash dole for farmers announced in the 2019 interim Budget. The Modi government had then introduced the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi to provide financial support of Rs 6,000 a year for farmers with less than two hectares of land and also proposed a mega pension scheme for those in the unorganised sector.\n",
      "The Budget would, however, provide an occasion to assess the fiscal health of the economy. It would provide a platform for the government to give a clear roadmap for achieving the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA) targets.\n",
      "The budgeted fiscal deficit of 5.9% of the GDP for the current fiscal is likely to be achieved, but it is nearly twice the FRBM fiscal deficit to the GDP target of 3% for the central government. Correspondingly, the debt-GDP ratio at 54% is also well above the target of 40%.\n",
      "The Budget Session of Parliament got underway Wednesday with President Droupadi Murmu addressing a joint sitting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.

      "Champai Soren, who was elected as the new leader of the JMM Legislature Party as well as the alliance, staked claim to form the new government with the support of the 47 MLAs in the 81-member House.\n",
      "“We have staked a claim to form the new government with the support of 47 MLAs,” Champai Soren told reporters Wednesday night.\n",
      "Parliamentary Affairs Minister Alamgir Alam, who also accompanied the ruling alliance’s delegation to the Raj Bhavan, said, “We have handed over a support letter from 43 MLAs to the Governor who has assured to call us”.\n",
      "The Governor told the incumbent alliance that he will revert on their proposal after considering the legalities. However, as Abhishek Angad reports, the Governor’s stance not to move quickly to fill the constitutional vacuum in the state triggered concerns in the JMM-led coalition of the JMM, Congress and RJD, whose tally of MLAs are 29, 17, and 1, respectively. In the Opposition camp, the BJP has 26 MLAs and the AJSU three. The CPI(M-L) and NCP (AP) have one MLA each while there are two Independents.\n",
      "Earlier, after more than seven hours of questioning by the ED in an alleged land scam case, Hemant resigned as the CM. He was subsequently arrested by the central agency.\n",
      "Late Wednesday night, Hemant also filed a writ petition in the Jharkhand High Court against his arrest, which will hear the matter Thursday morning. The ED would also produce Hemant before a special PMLA court in Ranchi and is expected to seek his remand for custodial interrogation.\n",
      "Speculation about Hemant’s arrest was rife since around 5.30 pm Wednesday, when two mini-buses were seen going to his residence. Half an hour later, Chief Secretary L Khyangate and DGP Ajay Kumar Singh also arrived at his house.\n",
      "The development capped days of political drama involving Hemant and the ED — from the ED searching his Delhi residence Monday to the BJP claiming his “disappearance for 40 hours” to the JMM hitting back at the BJP dispensation and the central agencies.\n",
      "Rahul Yatra in Bengal\n",
      "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will continue to make its way through West Bengal Thursday.\n",
      "The first phase of the Yatra in Bengal concluded on Monday, as it stepped into Bihar from Islampur. It re-entered Bengal through Malda district on Wednesday. On Thursday, it will pass through Murshidabad, the home turf of state Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is known as a staunch opponent of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC).\n",

      "Article 7\n",
      "Indicating cracks in INDIA seat-sharing talks, the Congress on Wednesday reacted sharply to the Samajwadi Party’s (SP’s) unilateral announcement of candidates on 16 Uttar Pradesh (UP) Lok Sabha seats on the party’s official X handle. Calling the SP move “one-sided and totally unacceptable” and hinting at a BJP-influenced “hidden agenda” to weaken the alliance, the party said while it is displaying a “big heart”, it should be remembered that it is being “vinamra (humble)” but not “lachar (helpless)”.\n",
      "Avinash Pande, the AICC general secretary in-charge of UP, who was in Lucknow to discuss the party’s preparations for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections and the UP leg of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, which is scheduled to enter the state on February 14, pointed at “other options” and said that those trying to create a “perception” against his party should know that “Congress vinamra reh sakti hai, sehyog kar sakti hai, lekin laachar nahi hai (Congress can be humble, it can give support, but it is not helpless)”.\n",
      "On the SP’s declaration of 16 tickets — 4-5 of which were allegedly being sought by the Congress as part of the INDIA bloc — Pande said, “It is totally one-sided and unacceptable,” adding, “UP ka karyakarta pasand nahi kar raha hai. Senior leadership nirasha mehsus kar raha hai. Ek taraf hum table par charcha kar rahe hain, ek taraf uske viprit Congress ko message de rahe hain (UP Congress workers don’t like it. The senior leadership feels disappointed. On the one hand, we are holding discussions. On the other hand, they are trying to send some message to the Congress).”\n",
      "Maintaining that while the Congress is proceeding for seat-sharing talks with a “udar dil (big heart)”, he also said, “There are certain rules of gathbandhan dharma (coalition ethics)… But the message being sent is that the SP is not following that.”\n",
      "Leaving open the door for reconciliation, he added that it is possible that such unilateral decision-making has happened without SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s knowledge, because otherwise, such a step — continuing discussions with the Congress, while going ahead and declaring seats — is “laughable”. Pande also said that the Congress could have done the same, but hasn’t, as it believes in taking other partners along.\n",
      "“BJP ki koi saazish lagti hai (Looks like a BJP ploy),” said Pande, adding, “Declaring tickets in such haste on seats over which detailed discussion has taken place, and is continuing, must not have been done with Akhilesh ji’s knowledge.”\n",
      "Calling it a conspiracy to weaken the INDIA bloc, Pande said that such “asmanjas (confusion)” — leaving Congress workers angry over the SP’s move — is unacceptable to him as AICC general secretary and in-charge of UP. However, he said, the Congress is hopeful that as everyone is working with the same motive of defeating the BJP, a solution would be found and such incidents wouldn’t be repeated in the future, adding that it would be harmful for all otherwise.\n",
      "Even PCC president Ajay Rai told The Indian Express, “Decisions will be taken by the party’s senior leadership, and we’ll do as instructed, but workers are certainly unhappy with the SP’s unilateral declaration of the ticket list.”\n",
      "Sources in the state Congress said the party is hopeful of getting at least 25-32 Lok Sabha seats out of the 80 in UP. A senior party leader said they are expecting an equal number of seats in each of the state’s 18 divisions, and a respectable total overall.\n",
      "Pande also indicated that the party’s coalition door is open for the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). “The INDIA bloc’s doors are open for the BSP, and will remain so in the future as well.”\n",
      "However, speaking to The Indian Express, SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said that SP does not understand why Congress making such statements when SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has shown a big heart by giving it 11 seats. “Akhikesh ji ne udar man se samman janak 11 seats chor di, RLD ke liye 7 chhor di. Ab chunao ki tyari karen (Showing generosity, Akhilesh ji has left an honorable 11 seats for the Congress, 7 for the RLD. Let’s now prepare for the elections ahead),” said Chaudhary. Asked about the Congress claim that some of the seats declared were under discussion, Chaudhary said, “None of the declared seats are under discussion for sure. Election is approaching and we have to prepare too.”\n",

      "Jharkhand will wake up on February 1 without a Chief Minister, after the Governor told the ruling JMM-Congress alliance that he will revert to their proposal to appoint JMM’s Champai Soren as the leader of legislature party after considering all legalities. Chief Minister Hemant Soren had submitted his resignation to Governor C P Radhakrishnan at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday night, moments before his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate.\n",
      "The ruling coalition of JMM, Congress and RJD has 29, 17 and one MLA respectively. In the Opposition, the BJP has 26 and the AJSU three. The CPI(M-L) and NCP (AP) have one MLA each while there are two independents.\n",
      "The Governor not showing immediacy has led to some concerns in the JMM-Congress camp, sources said.\n",
      "Congress MLA Dipika Pandey Singh said the Governor did not meet legislators of the ruling alliance: “We were given time by the Governor and then disrespectfully told to go. After seeing our majority, we have been pushed out. The Raj Bhavan is acting like the BJP’s agent and all elected leaders were asked to go.”\n",
      "Champai Soren, in a letter to the Governor, wrote: “I have been elected as the leader of the Legislative Party in the meeting of the Legislative Party of JMM. Subsequently, today itself, all the honorable MLAs of the alliance parties have unanimously elected me as the leader of the Joint Legislative Party. Along with this, I am attaching with this letter the letters of support from the leader of the legislative party, Indian National Congress, leader of Rashtriya Janata Dal, MLA and others. Thus, I have the support of 47 honorable members, which is more than the majority figure. Therefore, I respectfully request you to accept my claim and take action to appoint me as the Chief Minister for the formation of the new government.”\n",
      "Sources in the ruling alliance said the lack of a successor being appointed could lead to “a constitutional crisis”. “We have the majority; what is stopping the Governor? As of now, there is not even an acting CM. Whom does the Governor want to consult when there are no loopholes?” said a leader.\n",
      "Another added: “This gives time for people to meddle… If a new CM is not sworn in within the next few days, it will be a big problem.”\n",
      "In a post on social media, former BJP leader and Independent MLA Saryu Roy wrote: “There is no Chief Minister, no government in Jharkhand after Hemant Soren’s resignation from the post of Chief Minister was accepted by Honorable Governor. A constitutional crisis has arisen in the state. Short-term President’s rule is the only option in the state until an alternative government is formed.”\n",
      "Jharkhand speaker Rabindranath Mahato, however, told The Indian Express, “As of now there is nothing to worry about as we are in the majority. The government will function as it was functioning earlier. I don’t think there is any threat – we have and will prove the majority anytime.”\n",

      "Article 9\n",
      "Barely two months before the Lok Sabha elections, the embattled INDIA bloc Wednesday suffered another political blow — the late-night arrest of JMM leader Hemant Soren by the Enforcement Directorate on corruption charges minutes after his resignation as Jharkhand Chief Minister.\n",
      "This comes days after Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) walked out of the INDIA bloc and returned to the NDA, stunning the Opposition parties.\n",
      "Stumbling from one crisis to the next, the Opposition alliance, however, hopes to project the arrest of the 48-year-old tribal leader as yet another “outrageous political” move by a “vengeful” and “dictatorial” BJP government out to finish the Opposition and silence its critics. It is to be seen how the development will play out in Parliament, the Budget session of which began Wednesday.\n",
      "Late in the evening, INDIA leaders including Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, CPM’s Sitaram Yechury, NCP’s Sharad Pawar and DMK’s T R Baalu met at Kharge’s house to discuss the way forward.\n",
      "Soren’s arrest and the political turmoil in Jharkhand is a challenge to  the INDIA bloc, both in terms of larger perception and electoral preparedness in Jharkhand.\n",
      "On Friday, Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is set to enter Jharkhand. Nitish’s exit, Mamata’s declaration that her TMC will contest all seats in West Bengal, AAP’s decision to go alone in Punjab and the strain in ties between the Congress and Akhilesh Yadav’s SP in Uttar Pradesh — the sense of drift in the INDIA bloc is getting more pronounced.\n",
      "The Congress slammed the BJP government for Soren’s arrest. “ED, CBI, IT etc are no longer government agencies…they have become the BJP’s ‘eliminate opposition cell’. The BJP, which itself is steeped in corruption, is running a campaign to destroy democracy due to its obsession for power,” Gandhi said.\n",
      "Kharge, too, was scathing. “Those who have not gone with Modi will go to jail. To put the ED behind Hemant Soren to force him to resign as Chief Minister…is an assault on federalism. After having made the provisions of the PMLA draconian, intimidating and scaring opposition leaders have now become part of the toolkit of the BJP,” he said.\n",
      "“Those who have gone through the BJP washing machine have come out sparkling white… we will not be scared…we will fight from Parliament to the streets,” he added.\n",
      "Soren is just one among the several Opposition leaders who are facing probes. And the list cuts across party lines and ideological divides: from Delhi Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, Telangana’s new Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, his Kerala counterpart and CPM veteran Pinarayi Vijayan, former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, the family members of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, former Haryana Chief Minister and Congress veteran Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, the list is long.\n",
      "Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, too, face ED probe in the National Herald case.\n",
      "But the question is whether the opposition’s political argument finds resonance on the street. Last April, the Supreme Court declined to entertain a plea by 14 Opposition parties against misuse of Central agencies saying that it can intervene in individual cases but can’t lay down “separate guidelines” only for politicians.\n",
      "And in July, on the day of the INDIA meeting in Bengaluru, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it a “conclave of the corrupt.”\n",
      "Opposition parties, accusing the BJP government of misusing investigative agencies, have often failed to speak in one voice when it comes to many of the cases because of inter-party rivalries and local compulsions.\n",
      "Soren’s case, in fact, could be an exception since the Congress, the third force in the state, is an ally. The grand old party, for instance, shed few tears when former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia was arrested in February last year in connection with the excise policy case. Sisodia has been in jail for nearly a year now. Kejriwal too is facing the agency’s heat in the case with the fifth summons going out Wednesday. The AAP believes Kejriwal could also be arrested anytime.\n",
      "The Congress never really targeted the Centre or the agencies over the cases against senior Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee either. The CPM, another key member of the INDIA bloc, has often targeted the ruling TMC over charges of corruption.\n",
      "The Congress’s Kerala unit was upbeat when Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan came under ED radar. The AAP repeatedly spoke about the corruption charges and the ED probe against Bhupesh Baghel even as late as during the campaign for the Assembly elections in Chhattisgarh in November-December.\n",
      "The lack of camaraderie despite the shared belief that the BJP government is misusing the agencies to target the opposition could be a marker.\n",

      "Article 10\n",
      "Bringing an end to a long-drawn-out drama, senior JMM leader Hemant Soren was arrested on Wednesday night, soon after he had stepped down as Chief Minister. Before he resigned, he had spent the day being questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering case.\n",
      "Soren’s arrest came after he had skipped eight of 10 ED summons, the last being on Monday, when he allegedly “disappeared” before officials reached his Delhi residence for questioning in the ED investigation into a “huge racket of illegal change of ownership of land by the mafia” in Jharkhand.\n",
      "While dogged by investigations by Central agencies in several cases, Soren has insisted these are part of a political conspiracy to destabilise his Jharkhand government. For the JMM, the script is painfully familiar as Soren’s father, JMM founder-patriarch and three-time CM Shibu Soren’s political career remains tainted with a similar corruption allegation.\n",
      "A trained engineer, Soren had followed his family into politics and fought his first election in 2005 from the Dumka Assembly seat, but lost. Four years later, he found himself among the senior JMM leadership following the sudden death of his elder brother Durga, who was considered the natural inheritor of Shibu’s political legacy.\n",
      "Between 2009 and 2010, Soren had a brief stint as Rajya Sabha MP. He also served as the deputy chief minister when Arjun Munda headed a coalition of the BJP-JMM-JD(U)-AJSU later that year.\n",
      "In 2013, Soren became the state’s youngest CM, but his tenure was short-lived. In the 2014 Assembly polls, the JMM lost out to the BJP, leaving Soren as the Leader of the Opposition. The JMM also received a drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.\n",
      "Soren finally made his comeback in the end-2019 Assembly polls, leading an Opposition coalition to a win against the BJP, and himself winning from two seats, Dumka and Barhait. The JMM-Congress-RJD combine won 47 seats and Soren became the CM for the second time.\n",
      "However, almost from the start, Soren has been battling an image problem amid growing perception of rising corruption during his tenure as CM. In September 2020, the Lokpal of India directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry into a complaint of disproportionate assets against Shibu Soren and his family members.\n",
      "In 2021, former BJP CM Raghubar Das released documents showing Soren had acquired a mining lease in his name while holding the mining and environment portfolio. The Jharkhand High Court issued a notice to Soren, calling it a “serious matter”, and the BJP submitted a memorandum to then Governor Ramesh Bais, seeking the CM’s disqualification.\n",
      "The Election Commission (EC) later wrote to the Chief Secretary, seeking documents on the lease so that it could formulate an opinion under Article 192 of the Constitution, which deals with the disqualification of legislators.\n",
      "It is widely believed that the EC recommended Soren’s disqualification. The EC had sent its opinion in a closed envelope in August 2022, however, it was never made public. Insiders had argued that the issue was at best immoral, not illegal.\n",
      "Later, the Supreme Court struck down the PIL pertaining to Soren owning the mining lease filed in Jharkhand High Court stating that when the EC was looking into it, entertaining the PIL was a waste of time.\n",
      "However, despite repeated demands by the CM and his party, as well as by other parties in the state, the Governor declined to make the EC’s opinion public or to act on it.\n",
      "During a hearing, Jharkhand Advocate General Rajiv Ranjan told the High Court that the state government admitted it had committed “a mistake” and the lease had since been surrendered.\n",
      "In September 2022, at a special session of the Assembly, Soren won a trust vote with the BJP and AJSU boycotting proceedings. Soren gave a speech accusing the BJP of trying to bring down his government, and attacked the Governor for not coming clean on the EC’s recommendation.\n",
      "Over the course of 2023, the ED continued to summon Soren though the former CM skipped each one.\n",
      "In response to an ED summons in August last year, Soren wrote to the agency that it was “deliberate and part of the design to besmirch his reputation”. He added that Central agencies had been targeting him for over a year only because he was not aligned with the political party in power at the Centre.\n",
      "In response to a summons in December, Soren discreetly sent a letter to the ED stating that in the CBI’s preliminary inquiry – based on the complaint with the Lokpal – all his and his family’s assets had been disclosed. “Issuance of repeated summons is actually malice and part of a political conspiracy to destabilise a democratically elected government. The undersigned shall readily provide any information or documents which you may bona fide require and which are not already available with you, provided you are entitled to seek the same in accordance with law,” Soren wrote.\n",
      "Last December, Jharkhand Governor C P Radhakrishnan had sparked off a fresh controversy when in response to a query from The Indian Express on the EC sealed report containing its opinion on Soren owning a mining lease, and whether or not it will be made public, Radhakrishnan said, “I am repeatedly telling you, those who have done something wrong, those who are found guilty, have to face the consequences. We are aiming and moving towards a clean public life.”\n",

      "A DAY AFTER Congress leader Rahul Gandhi broke his silence over the exit of Nitish Kumar from the INDIA bloc and attributed it to his “reluctance” to conduct a caste survey, the Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) supremo joined words with him.\n",
      "In his first such remarks attacking his former partners at length, Nitish said it was “faltu baat (useless talk)” on Rahul’s part to try and take credit for the caste survey done by the Mahagathbandhan government led by him. He also questioned RJD leader and his former deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav saying that it was his party’s ministers who had led the job push under the Mahagathbandhan government.\n",
      "In another swipe at the INDIA alliance, Nitish said it “had not achieved anything”. “I have nothing to do with it now. In fact, I was against calling it INDIA. But they decided to go with this name. I had taken initiative to form it, but it did not do a single thing. Hence, I have walked out of it and joined the NDA. Ab yehi rahenge (I will stick to the NDA now).”\n",
      "The acronym, standing for ‘Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance’, is believed to have been arrived at by the Congress and Trinamool Congress jointly at INDIA’s Bengaluru meeting, with other partners taken by surprise.\n",
      "On Rahul’s remarks at the Purnea rally, which was part of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, that they had made Nitish agree to do the caste survey, the CM said: “Nonsense. Everyone knows I got the resolution passed in 2019 and 2020 for conducting a caste survey in Bihar. When the Central government did not conduct it for some reasons, we decided to go ahead and hold it in Bihar. We held meetings with nine parties.”\n",
      "Nitish, in fact, was talking of a caste census since before he switched over from the NDA to join hands with the Mahagathbandhan in August 2022.\n",
      "Asked about the allegation of the Opposition that the Central government was on a witch-hunt against its leaders, through probes by different agencies, Nitish said: “These agencies are investigating old cases. It is part of the process of investigation.”\n",
      "He also claimed that it was only after he took over as CM in 2006, for the first time, that the state had embarked on the path of growth and development.\n",
      "On Tejashwi comparing the achievements of the last 17 months of the Mahagathbandhan government to the 17 years Nitish has been CM, he said: “When I took over the reins of Bihar, he (Tejashwi) was a child. Everyone knows all the major development initiatives have been taken after 2006. Where were government jobs before 2006? We started recruiting teachers and giving jobs in other departments later.”\n",

The merger shows that even in Kerala people are convinced that Narendra Modi would retain power at the Centre again.”\n",
      "George had been a seven-time MLA from the Poonjar constituency in central Kerala, where the BJP has been trying to increase its influence among the Christian community.\n",
      "George had earlier been with the Christian party Kerala Congress (M) and had served as the then Congress-led UDF government’s chief whip in the state Assembly from 2011 to 2015.\n",
      "Subsequently, he parted ways with his party and fought from Poonjar as an Independent candidate in the 2016 Assembly polls. He managed to retain his stronghold, defeating the candidates from the CPM and the Congress.\n",
      "In 2017, George formed the Kerala Janapaksham (Secular), which backed the BJP-led NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. However, his party had then not joined the NDA as an ally.\n",
      "Even after floating his outfit, George tried to join either of the two leading political fronts – the ruling CPM-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF – but could not succeed as both fronts feared backlash from Muslims due to his tirades against the community.\n",
      "George, who once enjoyed the backing of Muslims in Poonjar, lost his seat in the 2021 Assembly elections – the first election he fought on his party’s ticket after “antagonising” the community. George also did not get the support of the NDA as it fielded its own candidate from the constituency.\n",
      "The BJP drew a blank in Kerala in both the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the 2021 Assembly elections.\n",
      "Looking to make inroads in Kerala, the BJP has been attempting to woo the Christian community, which accounts for 18% population in the state. Christians and Muslims have been traditional vote banks of the UDF.\n",
      "The BJP sees George as a bridge to reach out to the Christian community, particularly its Catholic segment, in central Kerala. George’s sway has however been limited to Poonjar, which he represented in the Assembly continuously from 1996 until 2021.\n",
      "Over the last several years George has been known for his proximity to the Sangh Parivar. He has also been at the centre of several rows over his alleged anti-Muslim remarks during this period.\n",
      "With a section of the Christian community having concerns over the Islamic fundamentalism, observers feel George’s induction into the BJP would fuel its polarising politics that may yield electoral dividends.\n",
      "In 2018, George had rallied behind the BJP during the party’s protests against young women’s entry into the Sabarimala temple.\n",
      "In 2022, George had sparked controversies by targeting the Muslim community, alleging “love jihad” and an “agenda to establish a Muslim country”. He had also asked non-Muslims to “boycott” restaurants run by the Muslim community.\n",
      "When he had then faced a case over his alleged hate remarks, the BJP had rushed to defend him.\n",
      "After joining the BJP, George told media that he is ready to contest from the Pathanamthitta seat in the coming Lok Sabha elections. “All the members of my party want to join the BJP. The most suitable decision is to give support for the Narendra Modi government,” he said.\n",

      "NINE missed Enforcement Directorate summons, one alleged “disappearing act” sending officials from Delhi to Ranchi in a tizzy, the seizure of cash and a luxury vehicle for “benami” registration, and another round of questioning at his official residence here on Wednesday – all this is feeding the frenzied speculation that Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren is readying for his possible arrest over several cases lodged against him by the central agency.\n",
      "The biggest sign of his preparing the ground for this possibility was the presence of Kalpana at a meeting held by Soren of his party JMM’s MLAs on Tuesday. Forty-three-year-old Kalpana’s name has been doing the rounds for some days now. An engineering graduate and MBA, she has also taken the lead in several initiatives of the JMM government lately.\n",
      "One of the biggest problems regarding this is that Kalpana is not a sitting MLA. The surprise resignation of the JMM’s Gandey MLA, Sarfaraz Ahmad, recently was seen as vacating a seat for her to contest from, if required. Since Kalpana originally belongs to Odisha, rules do not allow her to contest from a tribal reserved seat in Jharkhand. “The Gandey seat was seen as safe due to the number of minority votes there,” a source said.\n",
      "However, the ball in this case would be in the Election Commission’s court. With Assembly elections in the state due in November-December this year, the EC could take a call not to hold a bypoll, leaving Kalpana stranded as she must get elected to the Assembly within six months if she is made CM.\n",
      "There is another big hurdle in Kalpana’s path, and that is in-house – sister-in-law and Jama MLA Sita Soren. She is the wife of JMM patriarch Shibu Soren’s late elder son Durga, who does not share the best of equations with Hemant Soren.\n",
      "Speaking to PTI over the phone on Wednesday, Sita said: “I would like to ask why only Kalpana Soren, who is not even an MLA and has no political experience (as replacement)? Under what circumstances is her name being touted as the next CM, when there are so many senior leaders in the party… If they want to elect from the family, I am the senior-most in the house and have been an MLA for around 14 years.”\n",
      "Sita, along with Soren’s brother Basant Soren, were the two JMM MLAs not present at Tuesday’s meeting called by the CM.\n",
      "Given how the odds are stacked, some JMM leaders recommend playing it safe, and Soren handing over the CM post to an incumbent MLA.\n",
      "In that case, another source said, Soren may go by “seniority” and pick a JMM old-timer, such as minister Champai Soren, as CM. “Soren had made a coordination committee in 2022 giving each a Cabinet rank to run the government. This way Soren may also be able to avoid any confrontation within the family,” the source said.\n",
      "A source who works closely with the state’s legal department pointed out: “Conducting elections to a vacant seat is the prerogative of the EC, and it must conduct the same if there is still a year or more to go for regular polls. The Advocate General has advised that the constitution of this government’s Assembly should be considered to be… January 5, 2020, hence election can be conducted and Kalpana Soren contest. However, the BJP is contending that the tenure of the MLAs started when the government was formed, i.e. December 29, meaning the EC may not conduct a bypoll as the next elections are due in December this year.”\n",
      "JMM leaders are apprehensive that the moment Kalpana stakes a claim, the Governor may choose to consult the EC as she is not an MLA, and the EC could decide that the election cannot be held. The JMM does not want to create any situation that may allow the imposition of President’s Rule in the state.\n",
      "In the current Jharkhand Assembly, the ruling Mahagathbandhan alliance comprising the JMM, Congress, CPI(ML)(L) and RJD have a combined 48 seats in the 81-member House, well clear of the 41-seat majority mark. The NDA opposition, which includes the BJP, All Jharkhand Students’ Union (AJSU), and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP, has a combined 29 MLAs. The JMM is the largest party with 29 MLAs, followed by the BJP at 25 and the Congress at 16. The House also has two Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik), two Independent MLAs, and one recently vacated seat that was previously held by the JMM.\n",
      "As per other leaders, there is also the possibility that Soren may continue as CM, and run the government from jail. The party has reportedly consulted the Advocate General on this, with one opinion being that legally, there is no problem in this. A sitting MLA or MP is debarred from running for elections and has to resign only if convicted of an offence.\n",
      "However, JMM leaders are wary that the optics of Soren acting as CM from jail would play into the BJP’s hands, helping it “latch on to the corruption angle”.\n",
      "Earlier, Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi CM who is also in the ED’s crosshairs, had declared that he would run his government from jail if arrested. Several senior AAP leaders and two of his former Cabinet colleagues are already imprisoned.\n",
      "The biggest if, of course, is whether Soren will be arrested. A source said: “The BJP has been trying to disrupt the stability of the Soren government to project that he is a corrupt leader. There are political gains to be made in his arrest, as it would make Soren a martyr.”\n",
      "On Wednesday, Soren was questioned over the ownership of a piece of land in Bargai area of Ranchi, that can’t legally be sold, which the CM denies possessing. Apart from the charge against him of allotting a mining lease to himself while heading the department, Soren is also under probe over alleged inaccuracies in his affidavit to the Election Commission, particularly over the ownership of Sohrai Bhavan in Ranchi.\n",
      "The ED’s claims of seizing Rs 36 lakh from Soren’s Delhi residence on January 29 have also emerged as a point of contention now. The JMM has denied any links with the cash, alleging it may have been planted.\n",

      "Article 14\n",
      "The BJP sprang a surprise by winning the keenly contested election for the mayoral post in the Union Territory of Chandigarh Tuesday after eight votes of the Opposition Aam Aadmi Party-Congress alliance were declared “invalid” by the presiding officer, which tipped the scales in favour of BJP candidate Manoj Sonkar.\n",
      "The issue of the invalidated votes sparked a slugfest between the two camps, with the AAP-Congress accusing the BJP of committing a “fraud”. The AAP candidate later moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which on Wednesday sought a reply from the Chandigarh administration but refused to stay the election.\n",
      "How are votes declared invalid?\n",
      "The Election Commission (EC) has laid down guidelines for returning officers to help decide if the votes cast are valid or invalid. It also stipulates that no ballot – valid or invalid – be destroyed under any circumstances.\n",
      "The Chandigarh mayoral election was held with ballot papers unlike the Assembly or Lok Sabha elections, where Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are used. Ballot papers are used in most indirect elections, like the Presidential and Vice-Presidential ones or polls to elect Rajya Sabha members.\n",
      "As per the poll panel’s guidelines, a vote is deemed “invalid” if a ballot has no mark, or contains a mark for more than one candidate when only one is supposed to be chosen, or is marked with a type of pen or pencil other than the one provided at the polling station, or bears any unusual mark in violation of the official one, or marked in such a way that the voter can be identified.\n",
      "In the Chandigarh mayoral election, the returning officer is alleged to have made extra markings on some ballot papers, which were later torn — apparently in a scuffle between BJP and AAP leaders.\n",
      "In such a case, the ballot paper issued to the elector is taken back by the presiding officer, or a polling officer under the direction of the presiding officer, and kept in a separate envelope after recording on its reverse side, “Cancelled-voting procedure violated”, according to the provision in sub-rules (6) to (8) of rule 39A of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961.\n",
      "If an elector also drops the ballot paper in the voting box without showing it to the authorised agent, at the time of counting, the returning officer should put aside this ballot paper, and it should not be counted.\n",
      "What are some instances of votes being declared invalid?\n",
      "Every political party can appoint an authorised agent to verify whom its members have voted for, in case of indirect elections. In 2016, during the Rajya Sabha elections in Haryana, then Congress MLA Randeep Surjewala’s ballot was among 14 votes rejected after he showed it to another MLA instead of his party’s authorised agent. The election was won by BJP-backed Independent candidate Subhash Chandra while the INLD-Congress backed candidate R K Anand lost the election.\n",
      "During the 2017 Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat, the EC had ruled two votes cast by Congress MLAs in favour of the BJP candidate as invalid. The Congress’s candidate was its veteran Ahmed Patel. The counting was delayed after the Congress complained that “rebel party MLAs” had violated secrecy rules. The poll panel later held the MLAs guilty and concluded that they had shown their ballots to then BJP president Amit Shah, who was present in the Gujarat Assembly at the time of the voting.\n",
      "In 2012, the Presidential election saw the ballot of then Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav declared invalidated by the EC after he mistakenly voted for the Opposition-sponsored candidate P A Sangma and tore the ballot paper after realising it. He then asked for a second ballot paper and voted for the UPA’s nominee Pranab Mukherjee. The ballot with Mulayam’s incorrect entry was deposited with the polling officer.\n",
      "The EC ruling invalidating Mulayam’s vote said that it had come after the Sangma camp complained that the issue of a second ballot paper to him was wrong.\n",

      "Article 15\n",
      "On a day that Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra and her tour of northern West Bengal districts both criss-crossed Malda district, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee indicated she was in no mood for letting up in her attacks on the INDIA bloc.\n",
      "Tearing into the Congress, Mamata alleged that the party and the CPI(M) were working together to “clear the ground for the BJP” in the state in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, adding that only the Trinamool Congress was fighting against the saffron outfit.\n",
      "The Congress and TMC also had an exchange of words over the Yatra, with the Congress initially claiming that “anti-socials” had pelted stones at Rahul’s vehicle, breaking its windshield. The Yatra had re-entered Bengal via Malda early Tuesday. After Mamata claimed that the incident had not happened in Bengal, but in Bihar’s Katihar which the Yatra travelled through, Congress national spokesperson Supriya Shrinate posted on X that the windshield of Rahul’s car had broken due to a crowd surge. Another senior leader said the incident had happened on the Labha Bridge of Malda, but that Rahul was in the Yatra bus at the time, and not the damaged vehicle.\n",
      "At the same time, the Congress criticised the TMC administration for “security lapses”, claiming that most of the security had been diverted to Mamata’s simultaneous tour of the district.\n",
      "Mamata took out a padyatra through Malda town Wednesday, as part of which she walked for over a kilometre greeting people lining the roads, before addressing an administrative meeting.\n",
      "At the Malda meeting, she hit out at the Congress and the CPI(M). “I was beaten up by the CPI(M) during their rule, I will not forget that. I told the Congress that you do not have a single MLA, I will give you two seats (in Bengal) and help you win. They said no, they wanted more. I told them ‘You leave the CPI(M) first’. I can’t be with the CPI(M), which has committed atrocities on the people of Bengal. I have not forgotten it, and neither have the people,” she said.\n",
      "The CM added that the Congress MPs, both from Malda district, had done nothing for the people. “Barkat da did some work. That’s it,” she said, referring to the Congress’s two Lok Sabha MPs in the state, Adhir Chowdhury from Berhampur and Abu Hasem Khan Chowdhury — the brother of the late Congress Malda MP and Railways minister Abu Barkat Gani Khan Chowdhury — from Malda Dakshin.\n",
      "The TMC supremo also said that the Congress and CPI(M) will fight together in the Lok Sabha polls “to clear the ground for the BJP”. “It is only the TMC that fights against the BJP. We are continuing our fight against it. We are with you 365 days. We did everything for you. Every time an election comes, some birds start singing, some parties come here and spread canards (against the TMC),” she said.\n",
      "On the incident involving Rahul’s vehicle, Mamata later said: “I heard that someone pelted stones at Rahul Gandhi’s car. I found out that the glass did not break in Bengal, but in Bihar’s Kishanganj or Katihar. We never do this. This is not our culture. But we condemn the incident.”\n",
      "The TMC leadership has been blaming Bengal PCC chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury for the breakdown of the alliance, who, in turn, has kept up his attacks on the TMC. The Congress leadership, though, has said it has kept the door open for talks, with Rahul himself asserting that Mamata was an important part of INDIA.\n",
      "Chowdhury continued to harp on the state government’s “failings” Wednesday. Speaking about the incident involving Rahul’s vehicle, he said: “The West Bengal administration did not cooperate with us. I don’t know whether the glass broke or was broken.”\n",
      "“Rahul Gandhi’s yatra has gone through states like Manipur, Assam, Meghalaya, Bihar and West Bengal, where the Congress is not in power. Everywhere, there were attempts to derail the Yatra. Somewhere Rahul’s poster was torn, somewhere he was stopped, somewhere his car windshield broke. One thing is clear — whatever happens, the Yatra won’t stop. It will continue,” Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said, adding: “Khargeji had earlier expressed concern to Mamata Banerjee that someone could attack Rahul Gandhi to tarnish the TMC government’s image in Bengal.”\n",
      "CPI(M) state secretary Md. Selim weighed in, saying: “I do not know what Jairam said, but what Adhir Chowdhury said is correct. Our students and youth workers are ready to protect Rahul Gandhi in Bengal. We do not need any backup from the administration.”\n",
      "BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya also joined in, saying: “It has now become regular in West Bengal. Our national president was also attacked. Rahul Gandhi may be our opposition, but he is our guest. This incident is unfortunate for Bengal and can’t be accepted.”\n",
      "Earlier, the West Bengal administration had denied Rahul Gandhi permission to stop over at the irrigation department bungalow at Bhaluka in Malda district. The Congress subsequently changed the Yatra route.\n",

      "Three months after it decided to amend a 67-year-old regulation to allow the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals in scheduled areas, the Odisha government on Monday decided to withdraw the decision that had run into controversy.\n",
      "The reversal by the government seemed to have been driven by apprehensions of a tribal backlash ahead of the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in the state.\n",
      "What is the law in question?\n",
      "The Orissa Scheduled Areas Transfer of Immovable Property (By Scheduled Tribes) Regulation, 1956, allows the transfer of tribal land only to other members of the tribal community. “Any transfer of immovable property by a member of a Scheduled Tribe, except by way of mortgage executed in favour of any public financial institution for securing a loan granted by such institution for any agricultural purpose, shall be absolutely null and void… unless such transfer is made in favour of another member of a Scheduled Tribe,” the law, last amended in 2002, states.\n",
      "The law also prohibits the sale of land held by tribals if it means the remaining landholding held by them falls to less than 2 acres in case of irrigated land and 5 acres in case of non-irrigated land.\n",
      "What did the now-withdrawn amendment propose?\n",
      "The amendment to Regulation 2 of the Act allowed the sale of lands held by tribals to non-tribals and also allowed them to mortgage lands with public financial institutions for non-agricultural purposes.\n",
      "What forced the government’s hand?\n",
      "Protests broke out following the announcement, leading to the state government announcing on November 17 last year that it had decided to withhold the proposal. The announcement was made by Odisha Revenue and Disaster Management Minister Sudam Marndi, who had hailed the decision earlier, without elaborating.\n",
      "Opposition parties, which led the protests, called the amendment “a conspiracy against the tribals”. “We feel the amendment was made to legalise benami property transactions by land mafia in tribal areas,” BJP MLA Nityananda Gond said.\n",
      "A senior official, requesting anonymity, admitted the government feared that the tribals could take the wrong message from the amnendment. “The Opposition tried to provoke tribals with ill-intention. The government had taken the decision for the benefit of tribals following recommendations of the Tribal Advisory Committee (TAC). It later realised that the decision may hamper its tribal support base,” it said.\n",
      "How important are tribals in Odisha politics?\n",
      "Tribals comprise 22.85% of the state’s population. Thirty-three of the 147 Assembly constituencies and 5 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats are reserved for them. In 2019, the BJD and BJP had each won 2 of the reserved Lok Sabha tribal seats, while 1 was bagged by the Congress.\n",
      "In the simultaneous Assembly polls, the BJD and BJP bagged 18 and 11 tribal seats respectively while Congress got only 2. One each had gone to the CPI(M) and an Independent.\n",
      "The state is home to 62 tribes, including 13 particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs). There are 21 tribal languages and 74 identified dialects.\n",
      "How has the Naveen Patnaik government been trying to ensure tribal support?\n",
      "Apart from withdrawing the amendment, the Odisha Cabinet recently approved a Rs 100 crore scheme — ‘Laghu Bana Jatya Drabya Kraya’ or ‘LABHA’ — under which the state government will procure minor forest produce at Minimum Support Price (MSP) from 14 tribal-dominated districts.\n",
      "Chief Secretary P K Jena said the scheme would be fully sponsored by the state. “The Tribal Development Cooperative Corporation of Odisha Ltd, a state-owned agency, will procure the produce on behalf of the state government through Mission Shakti. It will benefit more than 30,000 primary collectors, 1,000 self-help groups in 119 blocks of 14 districts,” he said.\n",
      "Sources claimed the government came up with LABHA as a similar Central government scheme had seen no release of funds over the past 10 years beyond the initial revolving funds.\n",
      "The Cabinet has also approved the constitution of a Commission, with a rank of Cabinet minister, to “preserve and protect” tribal languages and dialects. “The commission will also help tribal children get education in their mother tongue apart from other languages at school-level. It will enable the government to set up a database to document and preserve endangered tribal languages and promote the use of indigenous languages in official communication to protect the linguistic diversity,” state SC/ST Development Secretary Roopa Roshan Sahoo said.\n",
      "In May last year, the government had set up special development councils (SDCs) in 14 tribal-dominated districts taking the number of districts having the body to 23. The SDCs, initially formed in September 2017 districts in nine districts with a tribal population of more than 50%, work to conserve tribal culture, traditions and indigenous lifestyles. With an expenditure of Rs 223 crore on SDCs, the government claims that the move has benefited 80 lakh tribals.\n",
      "Besides, the Odisha Cabinet has given a nod to the government sending another proposal to the Centre urging it to include 169 communities in the ST list of Odisha.\n",

      "The Congress-led Telangana government led by Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy has decided to install a statue of renowned balladeer, folk singer and revolutionary poet late Gummadi Vithal Rao, popularly known as Gaddar, on the outskirts of Hyderabad.\n",
      "Following the state government’s decision, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority moved quickly to approve the Tellapur Municipality’s proposal to set up Gaddar’s statue. The state Municipal Administration and Urban Development department issued an order Tuesday, allocating 1,076 sq yards of land at Tellapur in Ramachandrapuram belt in Sanga Reddy district near Hyderabad to set up Gaddar’s statue with a small park.\n",
      "While Gaddar had played a crucial role in the Telangana statehood movement through his folk songs and rousing speeches, he was perceived to have been sidelined by the previous Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) government led by K Chandrashekar Rao or KCR, who had differences with the former.\n",
      "“The statue is being installed to honour the immense and invaluable contribution of Gaddar not only to folk arts, music and poetry, but also to the Telangana separate state movement. I think his statue which will be unveiled on his death anniversary in August will rival other statues in Telangana,’’ said Congress leader M A Ali.\n",
      "CM Revanth Reddy said Gaddar had represented the Telangana movement’s cultural aspect with his soulful songs and music. While the specifications of Gaddar’s statue are yet to be decided, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have vied for installing the highest statue of B R Ambedkar. Gaddar is also widely regarded as a Dalit icon, who had been a key mass leader in the region for over five decades through his revolutionary poetry and songs.\n",
      "The Congress government’s move to honour Gaddar and its outreach to the families of those who died during the Telangana statehood agitation since 2009 are being seen as Revanth Reddy’s initiatives to seize the Telangana sentiment from the BRS, which has always projected KCR as the principal architect of the creation of Telangana state carved out of Andhra Pradesh in June 2014.\n",
      "Springing a surprise in the November 2023 Assembly elections, the Congress ousted the BRS from power, ending its nearly ten-year rule. In its election manifesto, the Congress has also promised to provide 250 sq yard house plot each to the families of over 500 Telangana statehood martyrs. The Revanth Reddy government has already started an exercise to identify these families.\n",
      "Aiming to wrest the Telangana plank from the KCR-led party — which changed its name from the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) to the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) — the Congress had also fielded Gaddar’s daughter G V Vennela from the Secunderabad Cantt Assembly constituency in the elections, but she lost to the BRS candidate.\n",
      "Telangana Congress sources say that the party dispensation is likely to accommodate Vennela in a suitable position in due course in a bid to reinforce its claim over Gaddar’s legacy and Telangana sentiment.\n",
      "Gaddar breathed his last at a Hyderabad hospital on August 6 last year at the age of 77. He had been unwell for several days, suffering a lung infection and other ailments. Shot at by unidentified assailants in 1997, Gaddar also had a bullet lodged in his spinal cord, which caused health issues for him.\n",

      "Article 18\n",
      "ASSAM CHIEF Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s constant attacks on Rahul Gandhi during the Congress leader’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra through the state carried the whiff of the bitterness in which their ties had ended. However, sources close to Sarma say, the CM’s offensive was also strategic, as it kept Rahul caught up in trying to firefight the Assam situation.\n",
      "Rahul entered Assam shortly after launching the second leg of his Bharat Jodo Yatra from Manipur, a state where a nine-month-long internal conflict has put the BJP government on the back foot. There was some apprehension in BJP circles that Rahul would carry the momentum of the Manipur kick-off into Assam, and generate a good response, especially among the Muslim community in Assam, that makes up more than 35% of the state’s population.\n",
      "Instead, Rahul’s Yatra found itself caught up in scuffles with security forces, over permissions of various sorts. On the day of the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration, for example, with all eyes on what Rahul would do – after top Congress leaders had pulled out of the event – he was not allowed to visit a revered Assam shrine. While he did a sit-in to mark his protest, Rahul eventually had to give up, and concede to the Assam government.\n",
      "Assam BJP sources say Sarma also ensured that Rahul was distracted from his main Yatra theme of attacking the Modi government. An offensive against the Prime Minister would have got Rahul eyeballs among the opponents of the BJP, which in turn would have given the Congress leader a boost ahead of his Yatra’s entry into West Bengal and Bihar, where it is covering or will cover minority-dominated areas.\n",
      "BJP leaders, in fact, claim that the way Rahul’s Yatra had progressed in Assam had spurred on Trinamool Congress Mamata Banerjee to flex muscles and declare the INDIA alliance all but over in West Bengal, just two days ahead of the march’s entry into her state.\n",
      "An enthusiastic response in Assam might have made her reluctant to do so, a BJP leader claimed. Her move, in turn, triggered a dynamo reaction among other INDIA partners.\n",
      "A senior BJP leader based in Delhi said: “The Assam CM’s constant attacks on the Congress leader meant many in the public were reluctant to be seen around his Yatra.”\n",
      "Officially though, the BJP maintained that Sarma was guided purely by law and order considerations, a claim repeated by a party leader from Assam.\n",
      "The Congress countered the BJP’s claims regarding the Yatra, with party Assam MP Gaurav Gogoi, who played a key role in it, insisting that it had been “a huge success” in the state.\n",
      "“The Assam chapter of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra touched upon the most important issue on people’s minds, which is the rampant corruption associated with the CM and his immediate family. The tag of ‘the most corrupt CM’ rattled Sarma, and his attempts to block the Yatra escalated after that comment,” Gogoi told The Indian Express.\n",
      "He also claimed that the state government not letting Rahul visit the Batadrava Than shrine on January 22 “boomeranged” on the BJP and earned tremendous goodwill for the Yatra. “Subsequently, in Guwahati on January 23, we witnessed a huge crowd for the Congress despite no local MLAs of the party in the city,” Gogoi said, lauding Rahul for raising issues central to the situation in the Northeast, including the conflict in Manipur, the unresolved Naga political issue, and Sarma’s “obscene” corruption.\n",
      "“Now it’s time to build on the momentum generated by the Yatra and prepare the ground for the Lok Sabha elections,” Gogoi said.\n",
      "As per BJP sources, the party’s public posturing notwithstanding, it had been taken aback by the response to Rahul’s first Yatra (September 2022-January 2023), including through party-ruled states (which was seen as reflecting poorly on BJP state units) – despite the Yatra’s political gains remaining limited.\n",
      "This time, the BJP was particularly conscious about not letting Rahul cash in on the resentment in many parts of the Northeast due to the Manipur situation. Sources point to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s three-day visit to Meghalaya and Assam beginning January 18 to address the plenary session of the North Eastern Council, four days after Rahul’s Yatra started.\n",
      "BJP sources admitted it had been a hurriedly organised programme, after Rahul had announced his Yatra.\n",
      "A party source said that given Sarma’s long innings in the Congress before he joined the BJP, the CM was particularly sensitive about the message that went out about the Yatra from Assam.\n",
      "As a BJP leader said, “Had Rahul made Assam the launching pad of the second leg of his Yatra, Sarma would have faced a lot of flak in the party. It would have been worse for him because of his past in the Congress.”\n",

      "Speaking to The Indian Express, Dutta said she could not get an audience with Rahul Gandhi when the Yatra crossed the state, claiming that it was the trigger for her to join the BJP fold along with her supporters.\n",
      "On April 20, an FIR was registered in Dispur police station against Srinivas on a complaint lodged by Dutta after she put out a series of social media posts, accusing him of “harassment” and “discrimination”.\n",
      "The Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) slapped a show cause notice on her later the same day.\n",
      "On April 22, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) expelled Dutta from the party’s primary membership for six years for “anti-party activities”.\n",
      "At that time, the Congress leaders had accused Dutta of having been allegedly in touch with the BJP leaders and levelling the allegations to lay the ground for her defection to the BJP.

      "A few days before her move, Dutta had staged a sit-in protest\n",
      "along with her supporters along the Rahul Yatra’s route as it crossed Sivasagar, her home district, in Assam. She had contested the 2016 and 2021 Assam Assembly elections from Sivasagar on the Congress ticket unsuccessfully.\n",
      "Claiming that despite her expulsion, she had been in touch with the Congress workers in Sivasagar, Dutta said several of her supporters from the district also joined the BJP with her.\n",
      "“There had been absolutely zero communication or anything by the Congress leadership to me about what is being done to address my complaint. Things got worse because they started ignoring the grassroots workers… During the last ten months, I have been on the ground with the workers and they say that there’s no one looking after the Congress in Sivasagar,” Dutta said.\n",
      "“We had a meeting with block and district level leaders and decided that since Rahul Gandhi was coming, we would seek a time with him and express our discontent. So we mobilised people but he did not find the time to meet us. His convoy just moved past us and this was a trigger for the people in the district. For the last ten months, they neglected not just me but the grassroots workers,” Dutta charged.\n",
      "APCC president Bhupen Borah, however, brushed aside Dutta’s move to join the BJP, pointing out that she was no longer a Congress leader. “Angkita Dutta had been expelled from the party. After her expulsion, it cannot be said that someone from the Congress has joined the BJP,” he said.\n",
      "Dutta, who had a long association with the Congress, was appointed as the IYC’s Assam unit president in November 2021. Her father Anjan Dutta, former minister, was a three-time Congress MLA, who had been the APCC chief at the time of his death in 2016.\n",

      "A month-and-a-half ago, a record 146 MPs were suspended during the Winter Session as the Opposition refused to relent in its protests against a security breach in Parliament. Though the suspension of 14 MPs was revoked on Tuesday – unlike the others suspended for the duration of the Winter Session, theirs had been referred to the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha privileges committees – the interim Budget Session is unlikely to be a smooth one. Opposition leaders are learnt to have sought discussions on a range of issues from the alleged misuse of investigative agencies and “attack” on the federal structure to the Places of Worship Act, 1991, and the proposed implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act.\n",

The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Tuesday became the first party to announce candidates for the Lok Sabha elections – it named 16 in its first list for Uttar Pradesh – but a Congress leader told Asad Rehman that it had yet again been blindsided by the Akhilesh Yadav-led party. The SP’s announcement came three days after it was taken by surprise by the SP’s public declaration that it had allotted 11 seats to the grand old party in UP. This episode is not yet over and whether the Congress mounts a pushback remains to be seen.\n",

While Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge last week reached out to West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to placate her and get the dialogue between the two parties going again, the Congress’s state unit president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, one of Mamata’s bitter critics, is not in a mood to relent. On Tuesday, he accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) of creating hurdles for the party’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. The TMC chief and West Bengal CM, meanwhile, urged people to unite under the TMC’s banner to defeat what she called the “Congress-CPI(M)-BJP nexus” in the state.\n",

      "Three days after the Samajwadi Party (SP) announced that it had allotted 11 seats in Uttar Pradesh to the Congress for the Lok Sabha elections, the Akhilesh Yadav-led party on Tuesday announced candidates for 16 Lok Sabha seats, taking the Congress by surprise. With this, the SP became the first major political party to announce candidates for the parliamentary elections.\n",
      "Many state Congress leaders said this was the SP’s “pressure tactic” to get their party to agree to its seat-sharing offer and that the announcement made without informing their leadership had blindsided it. While SP leaders insist that Akhilesh has already “finalised” seat-sharing, the Congress claims talks are still on.\n",
      "The SP’s first 16 candidates include three from the Yadav family: Akshay Yadav (Firozabad), Dimple Yadav (Mainpuri), and Dharmendra Yadav (Badaun). The other seats where prominent candidates have been announced are Sambhal, where sitting MP Shafiqur Rahman Barq has been renominated; Dhaurahra, where the party has fielded Anand Bhadauriya; Unnao, where former Congress leader Anu Tandon has been nominated; Lucknow, where party MLA Ravidas Mehrotra has been given a ticket; Ambedkar Nagar, where MLA and former BSP leader Lalji Verma has been fielded.\n",

      "Responding to the SP move, a senior Congress leader said, “At least four of these seats were supposed to go to us and the SP has blindsided us by announcing candidates without keeping us in the loop. The SP doesn’t seem interested in defeating the BJP. Our central leadership will decide what will be done next.”\n",
      "The Congress functionary said the constituencies of Kheri, Ayodhya, Lucknow, and Farukhabad for which the SP announced candidates were supposed to go to his party. “You should ask the SP leadership why they have cheated us like this,” said the leader.\n",

      "Defending his party’s decision, SP national spokesperson Rajendra Choudhary said that “no one has been kept in the dark”. He said, “The announcement has been done because the party’s candidates will need time to prepare for the elections. With a big heart and respecting the relationship between the Congress and SP, Akhilesh ji has already given the party 11 seats.

Chaudhary is a former minister and his son Kavindra Chaudhary is the SP MLA from Kaptanganj. Verma was the BSP’s Kurmi face and joined the SP ahead of the UP Assembly elections in 2022. At present, he is a general secretary of the SP.\n",
      "In the unreserved seat of Faizabad, a high-stakes seat for the BJP since the Ayodhya Ram Temple comes under his constituency, the SP has fielded Dalit leader Awadhesh Prasad. The SP has fielded Naval Kishore Shakya from Farrukhabad, a seat senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid has contested in the past. Khurshid who finished third in the constituency in 2019 is at present a member of the Congress’s national alliance that is holding seat-sharing talks with the party’s other INDIA bloc allies.\n",
      "“Votes that the Congress and the SP got in Farrukhabad in 2019 were not sufficient to defeat the BJP. We need votes from a third group apart from Muslims and Yadavs. Hence, the SP kept the seat with itself and fielded a Shakya (OBC) candidate there,” said an SP leader.\n",
      "The SP, meanwhile, also declared Lok Sabha in-charges for Varanasi and Mirzapur, signalling that it was also preparing to contest the seats.

      "As a row between the ruling JMM-led coalition and the BJP flared up in Jharkhand after Chief Minister and JMM leader Hemant Soren returned to his house in Ranchi Tuesday, state BJP president and ex-CM Babulal Marandi was at the forefront of making claims about the CM’s “sudden disappearance” while facing heat from the ED in an alleged land scam. In an interview with The Indian Express, Marandi maintained that questions would be raised if a CM remains “missing for 40 hours” and that the JMM leaders had faced legal troubles long before the BJP came to power at the Centre. Excerpts:\n",
      "You tweeted to call CM Soren, who holds a constitutional post, a “bhagoda (absconder)”. Do you think you should have resorted to such language against a sitting CM?\n",
      "He (Soren) is the Jharkhand CM. If the CM is missing for 40 hours and no one knows where he is, it’s natural that the question will arise as to why he is running away. If a CM runs from officers, from ED or CBI, what hope can you have of him protecting the interest of his state? What is the need to hide? This is what I have asked. He is CM, not an ordinary person. Even ordinary people like me who have security write down where we are going. Our security knows where we are going. He went to Delhi by a chartered flight and then came back perhaps by a private vehicle. I can’t say for sure how he came back.\n",
      "CM Soren says the ED raids are being conducted at the time of the crucial budget session of the Assembly so that his government is unable to function properly.\n",
      "How is it related to the budget? ED is not doing it today. It has given him many notices. If you say you have done nothing wrong, why are you running? Hold your head high then. If you are running, it means you have done something wrong, and you have no answer to the questions you will be asked. Many political leaders in the country have faced charges and they appeared before any Commission that summoned them. But Soren is organising protests and marches. What is the problem if the ED is doing its work? The bandh and dharnas you (Soren) are organising amount to anarchy. Lalu Prasad went to the ED’s office, Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi have also gone in the past. Even the present PM had appeared before a Commission in UPA days. If you have done nothing wrong, why are you scared? Why are you running? The CM is not above the law. Even legislators who make laws have to obey them.\n",
      "The Opposition parties are saying that their leaders are facing central agencies’ raids across the country just before the Lok Sabha elections?\n",
      "Elections take place in the country round the year. The ED, Income Tax department, the CBI, etc. work round the year. And he (CM Soren) is not getting (agencies’) notices just today. I think he has been getting notices for more than one year. When Hemant Soren’s father (Shibu Soren) was Union coal minister and Dr Manmohan Singh was Prime Minister, he (Shibu) was convicted, had to go to jail, and also lost his ministerial post. Was there a BJP government at that time? Recall the JMM bribery case (during the Narasimha Rao regime) too. Even then he (Shibu) was found guilty. He had taken money to save that very government, and agencies under that government itself acted against him.\n",
      "Lalu Yadav also went to jail before a BJP government was in place. Were Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in power at that time? Has anyone said that Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh or Shanta Kumar made lots of money or amassed property? There is a difference. These people (JMM) came to power for loot. Advani had resigned from Parliament when he faced accusations under the hawala scam and returned only when his name was cleared.\n",

      "Article 23\n",
      "The Maharashtra government on Saturday issued a draft notification saying Kunbi certificates could be given to eligible Marathas and their “sage soyre (blood relatives)”, which would entitle them to reservation benefits. The move has triggered fears among the OBCs that it would cut into their reservation pie, with OBC leaders such as Chhagan Bhujbal who is a minister in the government openly opposing the move.\n",
      "In an interview with The Indian Express, president of the Rashtriya OBC Mahasangh Babanrao Taywade explains why he backs the notification, and why he sees caste census as necessary to provide “justice” to OBCs. Excerpts:\n",
      "I do not see any reason (to oppose it). Why should we oppose the draft notification when it has said nothing new? It is just a reiteration of the old draft and the process which was already in place. An individual who can furnish required documents to establish his caste as Kunbi is entitled to the certificate and thus reservation under OBC quota. This is already in existence and the draft notification just emphasises the same rule.\n",
      "The draft notification may have used the term ‘sage soyre’ but is restricted to members from the paternal side of the family, like great grandfather, grandfather, uncle, brother, nephew, etc. This too was already existing. They have just emphasised it. Any expert who carefully studies the draft notification will acknowledge that there is nothing new in it.\n",
      "The draft notification will not have any adverse impact on OBC reservation. The OBC quota remains untouched. The apprehensions being raised by some quarters are based on wrong information… The notification mentions that the issue of Kunbi certificates to individuals and their blood relatives will be subject to verification. This means all Marathas are not going to be issued Kunbi certificates and only those whose name is registered in the revenue or education departments prior to 1967 will be eligible (for it).\n",
      "Another important aspect that nobody discusses is caste validity. Even if a large number of Marathas are issued Kunbi certificates by the Revenue Department, its validity will be decided by the Department of Social Justice, which mandates individual documentary proof.\n",
      "Frankly speaking, the government data which has identified 37 lakh eligible persons for issue of Kunbi certificates is correct. A majority of them already possess the certificate and have been availing reservation under OBC category for the past several decades.\n",
      "I urge everybody to study the facts. The present protest is political. Had the draft notification adversely affected the OBCs, I would have been the first person to hit the streets and fight. We have never compromised on the OBC cause and had warned the government against including Marathas in the OBC category. I must say we have succeeded… Ideally, there are no differences (between us and the other organisations). We are a social organisation and cannot politicise the issue. But if at any point we feel the government is issuing Kunbi certificates to all Marathas or violating norms of the draft notification, we will protest. Our commitment is to protect the OBC quota.\n",
      "We are going to launch an agitation on Wednesday from Deekshabhoomi in Nagpur demanding a caste census on the lines of Bihar. Our yatra will criss-cross all villages of Nagpur district and will culminate at Chandrapur on February 7 with a public rally. We will then plan the next phase. We intend to cover the entire Vidarbha region and eventually the entire state.\n",
      "It is very important and long overdue and necessary to ascertain the exact population of each community. The absence of a caste census has led to injustice against OBCs in terms of fund allocation and welfare schemes. There is data to back the 27% reservation that the OBCs get today. There are over 400 communities that fall under OBC and they should get reservation proportional to their population. We believe OBCs make up 60% of the state’s population. A caste census will only make things clearer and quantifiable.\n",

      "On the second day of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Bihar, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi broke his silence on JD(U) supremo Nitish Kumar, saying that his return to the BJP-led NDA was prompted by the fact that he did not want to carry out a caste survey. Claiming that as allies, they had forced the Chief Minister’s hand, Rahul said “we don’t need Nitish Kumar”.\n",
      "Two days after Nitish’s U-turn to the NDA on Sunday dealt a body blow to the Opposition’s INDIA alliance, Rahul said at the Mahagathbandhan mega rally here in Bihar: “Hum aapko samjhaate hain Nitishji kahan fanse (I will explain to you how Nitishji got trapped). We told him that you have to do a caste survey, we can’t let you off on that. He was forced to do the caste survey. Then he came under pressure from the other side because the BJP did not want a caste count. Nitishji beech mein fans gaye (Nitishji got caught in the middle). Then the BJP showed him a way and he went there. This (a caste census) is our responsibility, and we will implement it.”\n",
      "The Congress leader added that it was clear now that, apply a little pressure, and “Nitish makes a U-turn”. The caste survey confirmed the Yadavs as the largest single group in Bihar, and EBCs as the largest social constituency, in what was seen as a boost to both the RJD and JD(U)’s political planks.\n",
      "The Congress, RJD and Left put up a show of strength at Purnea, which was held as part of Rahul’s Yatra. The ground was packed with supporters of the three parties, though both RJD leader Lalu Prasad and his son Tejashwi Yadav had to skip the meeting due to appearance before the Enforcement Directorate. The RJD was represented by its MP Ashfaq Karim.\n",
      "While Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge was also expected to attend, he could not make it in time and a recorded speech of his was played. Apart from Rahul, the Congress leaders present included former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, Jairam Ramesh, Kanhaiya Kumar, Imran Pratapgarhi, as well as state unit leaders Akhilesh Singh, Tariq Anwar, Shakeel Ahmed and Ranjita Ranjan.\n",
      "Among the Left leaders, CPI (M-L) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, whose party has a good presence in Bihar, was among the senior-most names.\n",

      "While attacking Nitish, Rahul repeated a joke that had gone viral on social media after the JD(U) leader’s latest flip-flop, saying Akhilesh Singh had told it to Baghel, who had recounted it to him. “Your CM (Nitish Kumar) went to be sworn in as Chief Minister. There were BJP leaders, the Governor… He got sworn in, two-three ministers also took oath, and he left for the Chief Minister’s residence. On the way, he realised he had left behind his shawl at the Governor’s office… He asked his driver to make a U-turn and knocked at the Governor’s door. The Governor opened the door, and said: ‘Aap is baar itni jaldi aa gaye (You have already returned this time)!’,” Rahul said.\n",
      "Speaking about “economic rights” of farmers, Rahul pointed to the garland of makhanas (fox nuts) placed around his neck, and said: “This garland has at least 10 kg makhanas. I saw on the Internet just now that in the US, 10 kg makhanas are priced at Rs 1.5 lakh. But our farmers get Rs 250. They should get at least Rs 3,000-4,000 per kg. This is arthik nyay (economic justice). We are also fighting for this.”\n",
      "In his speech, Bhattacharya said: “Every day, our Constitution is being attacked. We have to stay together and fight against this.” Going on to talk about Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said: “The President should have inaugurated the new Parliament building but the BJP brought sadhu sants there, and the PM inaugurated it, like a king. The Ram Mandir is a religious issue, and hence a person’s private matter, but the BJP made it political, and the PM inaugurated it as part of its political propaganda.”\n",
      "In his speech that was played at the meeting, Kharge said: “Bihar used to show the political way to the country, but now it has come to be known for ‘Aya Ram, Gaya Ram (frequent defectors)’. He (Nitish) has played with the respect of Bihar.”\n",
      "Kharge claimed the Congress was in a “stronger position” than in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “The BJP is afraid and is sending Enforcement Directorate, CBI, Income Tax teams after Laluji and his family… We have to teach them a lesson.”\n",
      "However, in West Bengal, where Rahul is headed next, the Congress and Trinamool Congress troubles seem far from over. On Tuesday, Congress West Bengal president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who has been accused by the TMC of straining the ties between the two parties, again attacked the TMC, accusing it of “creating hurdles” in the Rahul Yatra’s way in Bengal and vowing to continue raising corruption issues.\n",

      "A day after the TMC questioned the Congress’s silence over the various probes against its leaders by Central agencies, Chowdhury seemed to hit out at this too, saying: “If there is theft in West Bengal, shall I say it is not happening?… Can’t we call people involved in corruption corrupt,” Chowdhuy told mediapersons in Murshidabad.\n",

      "When in the Opposition, Kirodi Lal Meena regularly made news for his protests against the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan. Now a state Cabinet Minister, Meena has said that he would seek a ban on the hijab in all government and private schools in the state.\n",
      "After the BJP’s Hawa Mahal MLA Balmukundacharya made comments against students wearing hijab at government schools, a group of Muslim girls protested outside the local police station on Monday demanding an apology from him. As the controversy erupted, Meena said he would speak to Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma about enforcing a hijab ban in schools. The minister also alleged that the Muslim community was “predisposed to criminal behaviour” and that a dress code should be followed in schools. On Tuesday, more of his ministerial colleagues, including School Education Minister Madan Dilawar, joined the call for a hijab ban.\n",
      "“Muslim samaj mein jo dharm ki kattarta hai aur uske karan jo sarkar hai, vishesh kar Congress ki, woh tushtikaran karti hai jiske karan ye aagey nahi barh pa rahe. Inme shiksha ki kami hai. Shiksha ka prasar hona chahiye aur Muslim samaj ko progressive soch rakhni chahiye balki unki soch crimes mein zyada ja rahi hai aur school mein jo dress code laagu hota hai uski paalna honi chhaiye (The fanaticism in the Muslim community, and because of the appeasement politics by Congress, they haven’t been able to progress. They have a lack of education. So there should be propagation of education and the Muslim community should have progressive thinking, but their thinking is more towards crime. The dress code in schools should be followed),” Meena said.\n",
      "“If a girl goes to school wearing the hijab, then there won’t be discipline (anushasan) in the school, and then the students will go to school in any dress. The hijab is banned in many nations and so it cannot be allowed in schools under any circumstances,” Meena said.\n",
      "While Balmukundacharya, a first-time MLA, has just started making headlines, Meena has been doing it for long. He currently holds the portfolios of Agriculture and Horticulture, Rural Development, Disaster Management and Relief and Civil Defense, and Redressal of Public Litigation. In the government hierarchy, he is next only to the CM and Deputy CMs Diya Kumari and Premchand Bairwa.\n",
      "During the five years of the previous Gehlot government, the 72-year-old, a Rajya Sabha MP at the time, grabbed headlines for his regular protests, hitting the road more often than many of his party colleagues and emerging as an almost parallel force in the Rajasthan BJP.\n",
      "From addressing press conferences and making “revelations” about the alleged involvement of people close to the state government in cases of leak of government recruitment exam question papers to “self-styled raids” with the media in tow, the issues Meena raised were often later picked up by the state BJP.\n",
      "Meena was among the first Opposition leaders to allege in 2021 that the Rajasthan Eligibility Exam for Teachers (REET) question paper had been leaked, putting the Gehlot government on the back foot. His protests became more intense as the Assembly elections approached last year. In early 2023, he sat on dharna with the wives of soldiers who lost their lives in the 2019 Pulwama attack, accusing the government of “nonfulfillment of promises”.\n",
      "What worked in his favour is that central agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Income Tax (I-T) Department often followed up on his allegations, such as the REET paper leak, the PHED scam where ED conducted raids on the then Public Health Engineering Department minister Mahesh Joshi, and the alleged black money in lockers in Jaipur’s Ganpati Plaza. The Congress cited this to allege the misuse of investigating agencies by the BJP.\n",
      "In 2021, Meena dodged the police and hoisted a flag of the Meena community at the Amagarh Fort in Jaipur following a controversy over a saffron flag being taken down at the fort. The action came even as tribal leaders accused Hindu groups of trying to appropriate tribal symbols. A sworn proponent of Hindutva, Meena believes, unlike most tribal politicians, that tribals come under the Hindu fold.\n",

      "Meena, who holds an MBBS degree, is known by monikers such as “Doctor Sahab” and “Baba”. He was first elected to the Assembly from Mahwa in Dausa district in 1985 on a BJP ticket. In 1989, he won his first Lok Sabha election. He is currently serving his sixth term as an MLA, and has been a Lok Sabha MP twice and a Rajya Sabha member once.\n",
      "He was a Cabinet minister in the first Vasundhara Raje government from 2003 to 2008. As differences with Raje crept up, he left the BJP in 2008. Before the 2013 Assembly elections, he joined the P A Sangma-led National People’s Party (NPP). Again, his political weight was on display when he helped a party unknown in Rajasthan bag four Assembly seats.\n",
      "From 2013 to early 2018, Meena was a vociferous critic of the Raje government. Then, in March 2018, in a surprise move, he returned to the BJP, appearing on the stage with the BJP leader who at that time was dealing with severe anti-incumbency. The party promptly sent Meena to the Rajya Sabha.\n",
      "At 13.48% of Rajasthan’s population, tribals are a significant vote bank. Of them, the Meenas are the majority. While the Meenas have traditionally been Congress voters, the BJP leader has forged a base among them for his party, especially in eastern Rajasthan districts with a high tribal population. In the elections held in December, Meena won from Sawai Madhopur.\n",

      "Twelve days after the election to the Chandigarh Mayor’s post was deferred at the last minute after the returning officer pleaded ill, the BJP on Tuesday pulled off a surprise win.\n",
      "For the INDIA bloc, it was yet another setback as the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had managed to reach an understanding for the post, and billed it as the first such election tie-up between parties of the beleaguered anti-BJP alliance.\n",
      "A look at what was at stake for the post whose tenure is only one year:\n",
      "It is a big victory for the BJP, which already held the posts of mayor, senior two deputy mayor and deputy mayor in the Municipal Corporation. As per the Congress-AAP tie-up, AAP was to fight the mayor’s seat, and the Congress, the senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor posts.\n",
      "After the BJP’s Manoj Sonkar won, the party also took the senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor posts, winning 16-0, as the AAP and Congress, protesting over the mayor election, stayed away.\n",
      "While the Congress and AAP are alleging that “the BJP played foul” in the poll, the latter has suggested there was cross-voting within their ranks.\n",
      "Given the shaky ground on which the Congress-AAP alliance rests in Punjab and Haryana, a failure to win the mayor seat could be a deal breaker for many in both parties, in both states, who are reluctant to join hands with each other.\n",
      "The Congress has seven councillors in the Municipal Corporation, and AAP 13, with the two adding up to 20 in the 35-member House. The BJP had 15 votes, courtesy its 14 councillors and the vote of the Chandigarh MP, who is the ex-officio member of the House; currently, that is BJP MP Kirron Kher. One councillor in the house belongs to former BJP ally Akali Dal.\n",
      "With a total 36 votes to be polled, the Congress and AAP hoped to have an easy win.\n",
      "This year, by rotation, the mayor’s seat was reserved for a Scheduled Caste candidate.\n",
      "The BJP’s Manoj Sonkar got 16 votes, while AAP candidate Kuldeep Tita (backed by the Congress) got just 12. As many as 8 votes were declared “invalid”.\n",
      "Soon after, protests broke out against the presiding authority for the election, nominated councillor Anil Masih, who was once the BJP’s minority cell office-bearer. The Congress and AAP alleged that he declared votes invalid in a “premeditated manner”, while Congress leader Pawan Bansal among others pointed out that the live telecast of the counting showed BJP leaders running away with the ballot papers and tearing them, before the Opposition could get access to them.\n",
      "Eventually, Marshals had to be called in to control the situation.\n",
      "Earlier, the voting itself was delayed by an hour even as, amid the confusion, Akali Dal councillor Hardeep Singh sought to exercise the NOTA option. This was rejected because there is no such provision for it in the mayoral poll.\n",
      "On January 18, the day the mayoral polls were to be held, AAP and Congress councillors reached the venue, when they were told that voting had been halted as presiding officer Anil Masih had taken ill.\n",
      "The AAP and Congress moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court over the matter, calling what had happened “unconstitutional”. Senior leaders of the two sides also claimed that the postponement showed how “threatened” the BJP felt due to their alliance.\n",
      "The Chandigarh administration argued that Masih’s illness and apprehensions of law and order had led to the postponement, and sought that the polls be deferred till February 6. However, the High Court ordered that the polls be held on January 30.\n",
      "Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal called the result “dishonest” and “very worrying”. “If these people can stoop so low in a mayor’s election, then they can go to any extent in the country’s elections.”\n",
      "AAP’s Punjab in-charge and MP Raghav Chadha compared what had happened to “treason”, and demanded the arrest of the presiding officer.\n",
      "Bansal said: “Congress and AAP agents were not given access to the ballot papers. The presiding officer… conducted a charade of an election… We were seeing live… If you notice, the presiding officer immediately vacated the chair after the voting and the BJP candidate was there standing beside him. BJP members rushed in, took away the ballot papers and tore them before anyone could even go in and see.”\n",
      "In 2022, after its win in the Assembly elections in Punjab, the AAP had stunned the BJP by winning 14 seats in the Chandigarh corporation polls compared to 12 for the BJP. But later, a councillor from the Congress had moved to the BJP, taking its toll to 13; putting it on a par with the AAP given that the BJP had the Chandigarh MP’s vote too.\n",
      "When the mayor polls came around, the BJP won, after one vote was declared invalid.\n",
      "Next year, in 2023, the Congress abstained from voting, with the BJP anyway ahead of the AAP with Congress councillor Gurcharan Singh having joined the BJP, and AAP councillor Taruna having moved to the Congress.\n",

      "As Nitish Kumar again jumped ship to switch to the BJP-led NDA and become the CM for a record ninth time, Bihar’s power shift dealt a severe blow to the INDIA alliance which seems to be on the verge of unravelling. The Urdu dailies kept their focus on these dramatic developments, sensing in them a denouement of the Lok Sabha poll battle even before its start. With the Opposition alliance in disarray, some of these dailies reckoned, Bihar’s turn of events could set off a chain reaction in other states, even as the BJP surges ahead unchallenged while looking to pull off a hat-trick.\n",
      "SALAR\n",
      "Referring to JD(U) supremo Nitish Kumar’s move to dump the Mahagathbandhan and ally with the BJP-led NDA to become the Bihar Chief Minister again, the multi-edition Salar, in its editorial on January 29, points out that the development marked another flip-flop by “Patna’s Sushasan Babu” as Nitish was earlier called for good governance. Nitish has earned a different reputation now, says the editorial, noting that he has repeatedly switched sides to ensure his survival at the helm over the years. “His rivals say Nitish is a cynical political operator who can resort to any manoeuvres without any principles for the sake of power.“\n",
      "The daily writes that Nitish had harboured the dream of becoming the INDIA alliance’s Prime Ministerial. When it was not fulfilled, he opted for another political somersault to flip back to the NDA fold. “It is another matter that Nitish had earlier said that he would prefer to die rather than aligning with the BJP. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had also said that the BJP had shut its door for Nitish forever,” it says, charging that both sides have now joined hands for their “greed of power”.\n",
      "The editorial states that RJD leader and ex-Deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has made his mark amid this turmoil and declared that “the game has just begun” and that the JD(U)will get “finished” this year. “Behind Tejashwi’s claim is the point that the JD(U) has been on a downslide for several years. In the 2020 Assembly polls, the Nitish-led party had slumped to third position for the first time since 2000. In Tejashwi’s view, the JD(U) would be marginalised and get co-opted by the BJP,” the edit says. “Bihar seems poised to reject the politics of self-aggrandisement played by Nitish. The stage seems to be set for young faces to rise and provide leadership to the state.”\n",
      "SIASAT\n",
      "Commenting on the rifts in the INDIA bloc, the Hyderabad-based Siasat, in its editorial on January 25, says that the alliance has run into trouble in West Bengal and Punjab over seat-sharing for the Lok Sabha polls. Upset by the Congress’s unwillingness to accept the seats she proposed, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee has ruled out any tie-up with the grand old party, deciding to fight alone in all the seats in her state, the daily notes. “Mamata was offering the Congress its two sitting seats out of 42, while the latter wanted four. The rigid stance of both the parties just for a couple of seats would affect the unity of the bloc besides undermining its objective of taking on the BJP in the polls,” it says. “Making a deal would be in the interest of both the INDIA parties. And their failure to iron out differences would hurt the alliance’s prospects in other states too.”\n",
      "Following Mamata’s move, the AAP’s Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann also announced that his party would go solo in all the seats in his state. “In Punjab, the situation is more complex since the Congress is the AAP’s principal rival there. Also, the relations between the two parties have always been acrimonious,” the editorial says.\n",
      "Both the allies should have shown flexibility and sagacity to fulfil the larger objective of the alliance though, the daily states, adding that their inability to hammer out the Punjab deal would damage not only their interest but also that of the INDIA grouping’s prospects. At a time when the BJP is racing ahead in the wake of the Ram Temple’s inauguration, the INDIA bloc has been tottering. Rather than stepping up their challenge to the BJP by reaching out to the people with common candidates and an alternative agenda, the INDIA constituents have remained engaged in their games of one-upmanship, the edit adds.\n",
      "INQUILAB\n",
      "In its January 26 editorial headlined “Maharashtra mein bhi bulldozer culture (Bulldozer culture in Maharashtra too)?”, the New Delhi edition of Inquilab writes that in the wake of the January 22 Ayodhya event, several observers have commented that the government has been steering India towards a “Hindu Rashtra”. “This may not be a correct assessment since the country has a Constitution, its constitutional institutions and many who firmly believe in our secular democracy,” it says, underlining that the regime of constitutionalism still defines India notwithstanding the point that “majoritarianism appears to be in the ascendant with the Sangh Parivar calling the shots in the country”.\n",
      "The daily asks, “The question however remains as to what degree the supremacy of the Constitution would be accepted and what would be the nature and scope of our democracy going forward?” It says such a question is increasingly causing disquiet as agencies mandated to uphold the rule of law, such as police, are often allegedly resorting to “high-handed and partisan” action against a community.\n",
      "This was reflected in the incidents of Mira Road on the suburbs of Mumbai, the editorial notes. While the police succeeded in curbing riots, it could not pre-empt the eruption of clashes in the area that followed a procession celebrating the Temple with provocative slogans. “Why were the arrests that followed these incidents were one-sided,” the edit asks, adding that subsequently the Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation rolled out bulldozers to raze several shops belonging to the minority community. “Are the Maharashtra authorities bent on sending out a message that the state has also adopted the bulldozer culture? If this is the case, it is unfortunate.”\n",

      "First-time BJP MLA Balmukundacharya, elected from Hawa Mahal seat in Jaipur, finds himself in yet another controversy.\n",
      "On Monday, videos went viral of his comments against students wearing the hijab at government schools during a visit to one such school on January 27, which was followed by a call by senior Cabinet minister Kirodi Lal Meena to enforce a hijab ban on Monday.\n",
      "On Monday morning, Muslim students surrounded a police station and sought an apology from the MLA.\n",
      "One of the four religious leaders elected on the BJP ticket to the Rajasthan Assembly in December, Balmukundacharya had hit the headlines for the first time hours after the results. At the time, he asked local officials to take action against alleged encroachment by non-vegetarian restaurants in parts of Jaipur’s Old City, questioning if they could sell in the open and whether they had a licence.\n",
      "In a video that surfaced of the Hawa Mahal MLA outside Old M M Khan Hotel, one of the more popular eateries in Jaipur, he can be seen pulling up the restaurant manager claiming that women cannot pass by the place, and that “sharabi kebabi (drunk and characterless)” persons who throng there spoil the atmosphere. He goes on to say this is “Apara Kashi (Our Kashi), not Karachi”, amidst slogans of “Jai Shri Ram”.\n",
      "Later, as a controversy followed, Balmukundacharya had apologised for these comments, while the Jaipur Municipal Corporation said that unlicensed vendors would be issued notices.\n",
      "Talking to The Indian Express at the time, Balmukundacharya had said the issue he raised was valid but it was perceived “in a wrong way”. “Rules say that meat should be cut in factories and then distributed. But here, there are unlicensed shops all around, leading to diseases. Now after I raised it, there is a queue of people seeking a licence. Where were these people for five years?”\n",
      "Like his campaign, the 48-year-old’s election campaign too had made headlines. He claimed the main issue in his constituency to be “an exodus from the walled city”. “Businessmen and those living here for generations are vacating. There is also encroachment of religious places, while old temples and structures have been razed or changed beyond recognition,” he said.\n",
      "Eventually on the day of the counting, till the penultimate round, his opponent, R R Tiwari of the Congress, had been leading, but in the final round, Tiwari received only 374 votes against Balmukundacharya’s 4,061, and lost. Tiwari eventually lost by just 974 votes, with the AIMIM and Aam Aadmi Party together polling 1,161 votes, and spoiling his chances.\n",
      "After his win, Balmukundacharya had said his priority would be the restoration of temples and old structures, developing parks, businesses, addressing traffic woes, installing cameras to provide security, deploying female police squads, setting up a sports academy and a yoga centre, all of which would help attract tourists. He had also said: “My vision is that ‘all 36 qaum (communities)’ are now my family. Hindus – which include Sikhs, hence there is no need to mention them separately – Muslims and Christians, we are all brothers. We have to change this city and make it beautiful, we have to restore the old form of the city.”\n",
      "A debutant legislator, Balmukundacharya is well-known among the locals as the mahant of the popular Hathoj Dham temple. The MLA had told The Indian Express that his family had a long-running tradition of pooja, sewa and adhyatam (prayer, service and spirituality). “Last five to six generations of my family have been devoted to temples, maths, ashrams and gaushalas. I myself run an ashram, mandir, gaushala and a gurukul. Hathoj Dham is the centre (of our religious activities) with multiple branches,” he said.\n",
      "According to Balmukundacharya, he had been associated with the RSS since childhood, apart from with the Bajrang Dal and VHP. “Wherever I went or worked, I constantly went to (RSS) shakhas,” he said.\n",
      "His formal education ended mid-Class 10, and Balmukundacharya said he later did learning in the Sanatan Dharma through pooja paath (prayer) and Vedic studies from a gurukul and at home. He is married with three people listed as “dependents” in his election affidavit. He also claimed to have been jailed twice over the Ram temple in Ayodhya.\n",

      "Tamil film superstar Vijay is poised to take the plunge into politics, becoming the latest addition to Tamil Nadu’s cinema-politics landscape, sources indicated on Tuesday. The actor plans to register his yet-unnamed political party in New Delhi in the first week of February.\n",
      "Sources close to the actor said the party’s registration was imminent, setting the stage for Vijay’s potential debut in the 2026 Assembly polls, rather than contesting the coming Lok Sabha elections. Sources said the actor’s registered fan group Vijay Makkal Iyakkam, which engages in many social welfare activities, is being converted into a full-fledged political party. The reach of the party, according to people close to the actor, is expected to extend beyond Tamil Nadu given his strong and organised fan base in Kerala and Karnataka.\n",
      "Insiders said the party’s formation was in a phase of meticulous preparation at the moment. “More administrative work is happening now, collecting Aadhar cards, voter IDs, and affidavits from over 100 people declaring they are not associated with any other political outfits, to be submitted to the Election Commission in Delhi sometime around next week,” said a source close to the actor.\n",
      "In the Tamil film industry, Vijay, popularly referred to by his fans as Thalapathy (Commander), is often regarded as second only to Rajinikanth in terms of his mass appeal and has long been perceived as a shy figure, an image at odds with his on-screen action-hero persona. His imminent foray into politics is a significant departure from his characteristic reticence, signalling a new chapter in his career. Vijay will join a long list of actor-turned-politicians in Tamil Nadu that includes M G Ramachandran, popularly known as MGR, Sivaji Ganesan, Jayalalithaa, the late Captain Vijayakanth, and Kamal Haasan.\n",
      "The 49-year-old actor is notably younger than the average politician in the state. He will be among a group of young politicians such as DMK’s Udhayanidhi Stalin (46) and state BJP president K Annamalai (38). In this group, film director-turned-aggressive Tamil nationalist Seeman, the 57-year-old leader of the Naam Tamilar Katchi, is the eldest.\n",
      "Vijay, As popular as film stars of the stature of MGR or Rajinikanth, commands a fandom much above Kamal Hassan’s or even the late Captain Vijayakanth’s. Many politicians, thus, are cautious of his foray into politics, although others anticipate it to boost alternative voices in the state.\n",
      "Vijay’s decision to enter politics has always been linked to his ambitious father and film director S A Chandrasekhar. A direct indication of his plans first surfaced last June, many months after he distanced himself from his father, when he attended a student rally in Chennai. There, he urged school students to ask their parents not to accept cash for votes from politicians and to educate themselves about leaders such as B R Ambedkar, Periyar E V Ramasamy, and K Kamaraj, sparking broad discussion.\n",
      "Given that he is younger and as popular as film stars of the stature of MGR or Rajinikanth, and commands a fandom much above Kamal Hassan or even the late Captain Vijayakanth, top politicians have been cautious in responding to rumours about his political entry when the reports surfaced. Figures from AIADMK leader Edappadi Palaniswami to Udhayanidhi to Annamalai have seemingly welcomed his move. Seeman even anticipated Vijay’s entry as a boost to alternative voices in state politics.\n",
      "Rajinikanth’s much-talked-about political entry was aborted by the star himself three years ago. In comparison, Vijay is on comparatively safer ground, buoyed by fans from diverse age groups, unlike the older demographic of Rajinikanth’s fan base. In contrast to Rajinikanth, Vijay’s strong Tamil identity also distinguishes him as Rajinikanth’s Marathi roots and associations with the BJP and the RSS have been points of contention in a state where Dravidian politics is dominant.\n",
      "For many years, like Rajinikanth’s followers, Vijay’s fans also have been accused of spreading rumours about his political entry to create hype and elevate the actor’s market value during big-budget film releases. Leo was Vijay’s last movie and Greatest of All Time, directed by Venkat Prabhu, is set to be his next release. In 2017, Vijay ruffled the BJP’s feathers with dialogues about GST in his movie Mersal. It triggered a political row, with Congress leaders such as Rahul Gandhi and P Chidambaram criticising the BJP.\n",

      "The RJD said the case was part of the Centre’s “sustained political vendetta” against Opposition parties, and also questioned the timing of the ED’s move, as it came amid Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, which is currently in its Bihar leg.\n",
      "Top RJD leaders have decided to stay put in Patna in view of the ED’s questioning of Lalu and Tejashwi, and will skip Rahul’s rally in Purnia. Only local RJD leaders will attend the rally, which is part of the Congress yatra.\n",

      "Speaking to The Indian Express, RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said, “One Opposition leader after another is being targeted. There seems to be an attempt to deflect media attention from Rahul Gandhi’s yatra.

      "The ED had on January 19, issued fresh summons to Lalu and Tejashwi in connection with the case.

      "The case pertains to alleged corruption during Lalu Prasad’s tenure as Railway minister from 2004 to 2009 in the UPA-1 government, which is being investigated by the CBI.

      "The Rajiv I Knew: And Why He Was India’s Most Misunderstood Prime Minister\n",
      "By Mani Shankar Aiyar\n",
      "Published by Juggernaut Books\n",
      "Pages: 336\n",
      "Price: Rs 799\n",
      "In his recently launched book ‘The Rajiv I Knew’, former Congress MP and ex-Union minister Mani Shankar Aiyar says he delves into Rajiv Gandhi’s political career to answer a lingering question of his: “Why did Rajiv, as prime minister, appear so often not to have control over what was happening around him and in his name?”\n",
      "In the search for answers, according to Aiyar, he has examined the highs and lows of Rajiv’s premiership, drawing from research and his time as the Joint Secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office under Rajiv from 1985 and 1989.\n",
      "This particular aspect of Rajiv’s premiership was written by Aiyar initially as part of his memoirs. However, it was later taken out and the earlier book was published as a more “biographical” account of Rajiv.\n",
      "From Rajiv’s reluctance to join politics to the people he appointed to his inner circle, Aiyar describes a man who was undone by his “good” qualities and lacked the “guile, deviousness and deceit which may have helped him become a more long-lasting PM”. “What made him a good man … was what felled him as PM,” Aiyar says.\n",
      "Among the controversies that hit Rajiv’s tenure as PM, Aiyar touches upon these two big ones, including the unlocking of the gates of Babri Masjid on the order of a district session court in 1986, almost four decades after it was sealed to prevent communal violence following the surreptitious appearance of an idol of Ram Lalla in the structure.\n",
      "“Of course, since it was in power, the Congress was responsible for the unlocking of the gates. But who in the Congress? The Congress chief minister of UP, or the Congress president and prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi? Stray remarks to me by the PM indicated he had nothing to do with this tragic farce and was deeply disturbed,” Aiyar writes.\n",
      "He further says that an internal party inquiry found that Arun Nehru, a cousin of Rajiv and Union Minister of State at the time, had used his clout in the Uttar Pradesh Congress to get the locks opened with a view to consolidate the Hindu vote bank behind the party. Nehru was subsequently dropped from the Cabinet.\n",
      "“Rajiv Gandhi was not consulted because he would never have agreed to such an unprincipled step. So, the ‘formidable cousin’ decided to present the prime minister with a fait accompli, unmindful (or, perhaps, conscious) that this would stir the cauldron of communalism,” Aiyar writes.\n",
      "However, three years later, with weeks to go for the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, the Rajiv government permitted the VHP to conduct a shilanyas or “foundation stone laying ceremony” at the site. Aiyar admits it as “the single most important cause for Rajiv Gandhi’s defeat” in the elections that followed.\n",
      "Another major issue that would shadow Rajiv’s legacy was his government’s actions in the Shah Bano case. In 1985, the Supreme Court had held that Bano was entitled to alimony after her husband divorced her. With opposition from the Muslim side that saw the ruling as violating the Muslim Personal Law, the Rajiv government brought the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act in Parliament, nullifying in effect the apex court’s judgement. The Opposition criticised the decision as “minority appeasement” and “discriminatory” towards Muslim women.\n",
      "In 2001, incidentally, 10 years after Rajiv’s killing, the Supreme Court upheld the Act, saying it did not remove the liability of Muslim husband to pay his divorced wife maintenance, and that this was not confined to the iddat period of three months.\n",
      "Aiyar points to this, writing: “Perhaps the most significant part of the 2001 SC judgement on the 1986 Act was its finding that ‘the provisions of the Act do not offend Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India… And that explains why Rajiv Gandhi’s Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, remains on the statute books despite India having seen at least 12 governments since then, most of them led by prime ministers who had spoken against the Bill, inside or outside Parliament… It is hence clear that the late Rajiv Gandhi had been quite unfairly accused of Muslim ‘appeasement – a favourite concoction of both the Sangh Parivar and the left-liberal intelligentsia… In fact, the continued criticism of the Act … is an egregious example of ‘appeasing’ extremist sections of the majority community. It also gave the lie to the media assertion… that the 1986 Act was meant to balance the opening of the locks at the Babri Masjid in a failed attempt to cater to religious sentiment on both sides for illicit political gain.”\n",
      "Aiyar adds that Rajiv waded into the issue against the advice of the Director of Minority Affairs in his PMO and despite anticipating the charges of “Muslim appeasement” and “vote-bank politics”, because he believed his duty as PM was “to hold the country together”.\n",
      "“I have the advantage of hindsight that Rajiv Gandhi in 1986 did not. Yet he spotted that ignoring or surrendering on this issue would promote precisely the kind of majoritarianism that has now overtaken the country,” Aiyar writes.\n",
      "Among the most prominent controversies faced by the Congress government under Rajiv was the Bofors scandal. In the book, Aiyar offers a staunch defence of Rajiv on the bribery allegations regarding a deal with the Swedish arms manufacturer, which first emerged in 1987.\n",
      "“It was the Rajiv Gandhi government, none other, that requested the Swedish authorities, through proper diplomatic channels, to undertake the probe. Why … would RG, of his own volition, put matters in the hands of a foreign investigation agency over which he would have no control – unless he knew he was innocent of any wrongdoing?” Aiyar writes.\n",
      "Aiyar addresses the allegations and the ensuing investigations and legal cases in detail before arriving at the conclusion that it was Arun Nehru who received the alleged kickbacks, which stopped after he was removed from Rajiv’s Cabinet, through an intermediary called AE Services.\n",
      "“AE Services eventually received only the first of the five instalments to which it was contractually entitled… After the first payment in August-September 1986, while Nehru was still in office, Bofors cancelled its contract with AE and abruptly stopped all payments immediately after Nehru was kicked out… in October 1986. Why should the payments have ended? If RG was involved in contracting AE Services on the terms set out, he, unlike Arun Nehru, remained very much in office for the next thousand days,” Aiyar writes.\n",
      "Aiyar again talks of Rajiv putting “national interest above his own”, pointing out that the row played a role in the Congress’s defeat in the 1989 elections. He adds that Rajiv ultimately “won the moral war” on the Bofors issue, with revelations from a whistleblower and a Delhi High Court ruling in 2004 clearing the late PM of any wrongdoing.\n",
      "“Bofors was not a scam, but a sting operation mounted by this cohort on the inside track and their allies in the media and the Opposition. The inner party conspirators… rallied around V P Singh and Arun Nehru as they saw the prospects of huge funds from defence deals slipping out of their hands. It was they who went on to form the National Front that toppled the Rajiv government – albeit for no more than a few months before they were consigned to the dustbin of history,” Aiyar writes.\n",
      "On the foreign policy front was India’s involvement in Sri Lanka’s civil war, between the Tamil separatist LTTE and the Sinhalese-majority government. When Rajiv became the PM, India was playing the role of mediator in the conflict. But that changed when Rajiv gave India the role of “guarantor” and signed a peace accord in 1987 with Sri Lankan President J R Jayawardene, which excluded the LTTE but sought to create self-government in the Tamil-majority regions in northern Sri Lanka. While Indian officials wrongly believed the LTTE was unhappy with the agreement, a Marxist uprising broke out in Sinhalese-majority regions in the south.\n",
      "“Without seeking time to consult his experts… the PM immediately agreed that an Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) would be shipped out to act as a buffer between Tamil insurgents and the Sri Lankan army to enable the Sri Lankan government to concentrate its armed forces against the threatened Marxist takeover… The experts were somewhat stunned when they heard about the PM’s extramural decision… He acted decisively – and took on his chin the consequences,” Aiyar writes.\n",
      "Within months, with the LTTE intent on continuing its fight for an independent state, the militant group was engaged in direct hostilities with the IPKF, which was later accused of committing human rights violations. As Rajiv refused to withdraw the India troops, Tamil and Sinhalese sentiments turned against the IPKF. It was only after the Congress’s defeat in the 1989 Lok Sabha polls that India began withdrawing from Sri Lanka under PM V P Singh.\n",
      "“The IPKF expedition was a disaster. Military incompetence ruined it at the start and military competence later never retrieved the initial damage. This was compounded by a total misreading by our intelligence/diplomatic/political establishment of the LTTE and its dedication to its inflexible goal of setting up an independent, sovereign Tamil state by force of arms,” Aiyar writes.\n",
      "Eventually, LTTE cadres and sympathisers were convicted for the 1991 assassination of Rajiv.\n",
      "Though Rajiv began his term as PM in the aftermath of the nationwide anti-Sikh riots following the assassination of his mother and then PM Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984, Aiyar credits Rajiv with bringing “normalcy” to Punjab after signing an accord with the agitating Akali Dal, which went on to win the delayed Assembly polls in 1985.\n",
      "“The awful late Seventies and early Eighties have been relegated to the past. Rajiv Gandhi may not have succeeded in implementing the Punjab Accord, but his consistent actions – from releasing Sant Harchand Singh Longowal in January 1985 to visiting Hussainiwala in March 1985; preventing vengeance killings with an iron hand when eleven transistor bombs went off in Delhi in May 1985; signing the accord in July 1985; holding elections in September 1985; setting tight deadlines for the implementation of the accord; then conceiving and supervising Operation Black Thunder II – are what moved the state towards the normalcy that now prevails,” Aiyar writes.\n",
      "The Punjab Accord was followed shortly after with one in Assam to end the student agitation against illegal migration, following which the Asom Gana Parishad ousted the Congress in the 1985 Assembly elections. Aiyar writes that Rajiv sacrificed electoral gains for the Congress in favour of national interest. “Rajiv Gandhi would pay a heavy price within the party for the Congress losing the states of Punjab and Assam in quick succession in 1985. That was typical of the man, putting national interest above party interest,” he writes.\n",
      "Near the end of his tenure, Rajiv’s efforts to end the agitation for a separate Gorkhaland state resulted in the 1988 Darjeeling Accord, which created a semi-autonomous council to oversee Darjeeling. “The Darjeeling Accord was the final feather in Rajiv Gandhi’s cap, vindicating his policy of not regarding dissidents as enemies, but partners in nation-building whose concerns should be heard, understood, and accommodated,” writes Aiyar.\n",
      "The Panchayati Raj system, introduced in 1992 through a Constitutional Amendment, has its roots in Rajiv’s tenure as PM. Among the notable features of the amendment were the reservations for women and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n",
      "Though the original amendments, drafted by Aiyar and others during Rajiv’s term, did not clear the Rajya Sabha despite passage in the Lok Sabha in 1989, Aiyar says “it is his most lasting contribution to this nation” and “arguably the most significant since freedom came at midnight”.\n",
      "“I felt I was at our second ‘tryst with destiny’, as this was, in my view, the single most historic amendment to the Constitution,” Aiyar writes.\n",
      "But, after Rajiv had delivered what would be his last speech in Parliament in the Rajya Sabha later that year, the amendment fell short of the required two-third majority by three votes.\n",
      "After his single term as PM, Rajiv was the Leader of Opposition in Parliament, until he was assassinated.\n",
      "“While several new beginnings were signalled in his first term of office, had RG been destined for further terms as prime minister, many of his dreams for the nation would have been more fully realised,” Aiyar writes.\n",
      "Aiyar concludes by saying Rajiv performed “pretty well” as a PM, given that he was “unexpectedly elevated to the highest office in the land… after a preparatory period of political probation that lasted only two to three years”.\n",
      "“But as setbacks occurred, he accepted advice from those with longer political experience. Unfortunately, these ‘expert’ political advisers often led him up the garden path – but, of course, he had only himself to blame for accepting their advice. He had little guile and no deception in his dealings with political colleagues and opponents. He was intelligent, intellectually alive, tireless, and dedicated to improving the moral tone of our democracy,” Aiyar writes.\n",

      "The Congress’s efforts to consolidate Lingayat votes ahead of the Lok Sabha elections suffered a blow last week after former Chief Minister and one of the tallest Lingayat leaders, Jagadish Shettar, returned to the BJP barely nine months after he joined the ruling party in the state.\n",
      "In an interview, Shettar speaks about his time in the Congress, what prompted him to make the move, and how the change in state BJP leadership influenced his decision.\n",
      "Excerpts:\n",
      "What led to your change of heart and return to the BJP only nine months after joining the Congress?\n",
      "There is only one reason. When I left the Congress, I did not make any allegations that they did not give me a position. They treated me respectfully and I duly thanked the CM (Siddaramaiah), Deputy CM (D K Shivakumar), and the others for that.\n",
      "However, the BJP is a party with which I was associated for 30-40 years. After I quit (ahead of last year’s Assembly elections), the cadre wanted me back. Everywhere I went over the last few months, I heard the same thing. They said there might have been a mistake and insisted that I return to the BJP. Apart from the cadre, leaders also were of the same opinion. Leaders such as K S Eshwarappa and D V Sadananda Gowda issued public statements asking me to return. Other party leaders too felt that I must rejoin the party which I helped build in the state.\n",
      "Also, B Y Vijayendra and B S Yediyurappa, who were in touch with me after assuming charge of the party’s state unit, insisted that I work with them to help Narendra Modi become Prime Minister again. BJP central leaders also showed, through various sources, that they wanted me to return. We then held talks, where they asked me to forget what had happened.\n",
      "Apart from this, I also want Modi to become the PM again as his administration over the past 10 years has been good. I decided to return to strengthen his hand. This (BJP) is our house.\n",
      "Leaders like Laxman Savadi also quit the BJP at the same time as you. Is he returning to the party fold too?\n",
      "I am not in touch with him. He has not contacted me on this nor have I.\n",
      "After you left the party there were allegations that Lingayats were sidelined in the state BJP. Will your return help the BJP consolidate its Lingayat base?\n",
      "Workers and (Lingayat) community members across the state have welcomed my decision to return. They told me that there was confusion after I left (the BJP) and assured me they would work for the BJP after my return. The signal sent out to the community is positive.\n",
      "Within the community too, there is a feeling that Modi’s leadership should continue and that there would be confusion if I remained in the Congress. My return has cleared this ambiguity. The entire community now says they will wholeheartedly support Modi ji.\n",
      "During your tenure as a Congress MLC, there was speculation that you would contest the Lok Sabha polls.\n",
      "Yes, but none of the Congress leaders seriously discussed it with me.\n",
      "You have been active in electoral politics for more than three decades and have contested successive elections. Does your return mean you will contest the Lok Sabha polls as a BJP candidate?\n",
      "I will do whatever the party tells me to. If they want me to contest (Lok Sabha), I will. I will abide by the decision of the leadership.\n",
      "You are considered a strong contender for the Belgaum, Dharwad or Haveri Lok Sabha seats. What is your say?\n",
      "No, I have not insisted on contesting from any particular Lok Sabha seat. I will contest from wherever the party fields me.\n",
      "You were very critical of BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh when you quit the party. Was your return possible after you addressed the differences you had with him?\n",
      "When I left the BJP, I did not blame the party. I had said that (the decision to deny a ticket) was due to some vested interests. It was due to some people and not because of the party. The BJP has always helped me and I had said some people from the state had caused this.\n",
      "You had mentioned Santhosh specifically …\n",
      "Only personalities and not the party. My complaint was against individuals and not leaders from Delhi.\n",
      "Have you been able to address the differences with Santhosh?\n",
      "I don’t want to explain that. Please see what is the situation in the state BJP now and what it was earlier. If you ask those in the inner circles, you will know what has changed since Vijayendra took over (as Karnataka BJP president).\n",
      "Were you unhappy when you were with the Congress?\n",
      "No, I have no complaints. They made me MLC and treated me respectfully. I won’t criticise my time there.\n",
      "What are your prospects in the BJP in the coming days as you are a senior leader and a former CM?\n",
      "I only expect to be treated with respect as I have worked for the party for 30 years. I would have not taken the decision (to quit the party in 2023) if leaders from Delhi had called me a few days before (I quit) and asked me not to contest polls and offered me a party position.\n",

      "Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal (United) supremo Nitish Kumar’s move to dump the Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) and switch to the BJP-led NDA camp is likely to have its repercussions for Uttar Pradesh politics too.\n",
      "The dramatic turn of events in Bihar is likely to hit the Samajwadi Party (SP)’s bid in UP to woo Kurmis – a dominant OBC community that is a part of SP national president Akhilesh Yadav’s targeted support base of “Pichchde (backwards), Dalits and Alpsankhyak (minorities)” or PDA.\n",
      "After Nitish took the oath as the CM again at the head of the NDA government Sunday, Akhilesh, in a post on “X”, accused the BJP of allegedly conspiring and limiting a “future Prime Minister” to the post of the CM. His message claimed that Nitish could have been the PM if he had continued with the Opposition INDIA bloc.\n",
      "There had been a buzz in political circles last year that Nitish may contest the 2024 Lok Sabha elections from UP with the support of the SP in order to position himself as a challenger of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The JD(U)’s UP unit had proposed three seats in this regard for Nitish’s consideration – Mirzapur, Phulpur and Ambedkar Nagar – which have strong OBC presence, mostly of Kurmis.\n",
      "Then a banner had also surfaced outside the SP headquarters in Lucknow that featured a photograph of Nitish with Akhilesh amid a slogan: “UP + Bihar = Gayi Modi Sarkar.”\n",
      "Nitish belongs to the Kurmi community, whose vote is decisive in several constituencies in eastern and central UP as well as Bundelkhand.\n",
      "Kurmis are a landowning farming community whose status varies across regions in various states including UP, Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand.\n",
      "A Social Justice Committee set up by then CM Rajnath Singh in June 2001 had estimated that OBCs constituted 43.13% of UP’s population, of which Yadavs were 19.4% and Kurmis 7.46%.\n",
      "After the demise of ex-Union minister Beni Prasad Verma in 2020, the SP has lacked a Kurmi face. Verma was considered “number 2” to Mulayam Singh Yadav in the party for several years. To reach out to non-Yadav OBCs, especially Kurmis, ahead of 2017 Assembly elections, Akhilesh had appointed Naresh Uttam Patel as the state party chief, who is still continuing in his post.\n",
      "Ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections, the BSP’s Kurmi leader Lalji Verma joined the SP. A few weeks later, the BJP’s then Nanpara MLA Madhuri Verma joined the SP. Madhuri contested the Assembly election on the SP ticket but lost. Lalji won the election from Katehri. Akhilesh later inducted Lalji in the pary national executive as a general secretary.\n",
      "As a part of its outreach to the Kurmi community, the SP also forged an alliance with the Apna Dal (Kamerawadi) founded by Krishna Patel, wife of late Sonelal Patel, a prominent Kurmi leader and founder of the Apna Dal.\n",
      "“If Nitish ji would have continued in INDIA alliance and travelled in UP, that would have benefited the SP and Congress both. Kurmi had presence in over 40 districts of UP. Just like Kurmis and Yadavs came together in Bihar when JD(U) had alliance with RJD, same social equations could have developed in UP too. But Nitish’s exit from INDIA has dealt a setback to that strategy. Current UP situation is appearing to favour BJP that already has an alliance with OBC-based parties,” said an SP leader.\n",
      "The BJP has an alliance with the Apna Dal (Sonelal), a party faction led by Union minister Anupriya, Nishad Party and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP).\n",
      "In July last year, SP leader Sushma Patel from a politically influential Kurmi family of Jaunpur district in eastern UP quit the party to join the BJP.\n",
      "In November, the SP got another setback when its founder member and three-time MP from Lakhimpur Kheri, Ravi Prakash Verma, a prominent Kurmi leader, quit the party\n",
      "along with his daughter Purvi Verma to join the Congress.\n",
      "“If Nitish had been in INDIA, that would have benefited both SP and JD(U). But Nitish as an individual has no impact in UP. JD(U) candidates had been losing elections. So, Nitish’s exit from INDIA is not going to cause any damage to SP in UP,” said Lalji Verma, SP national general secretary.\n",
      "The state BJP had seen three Kurmi presidents – Om Prakash Singh, Vinay Katiyar and Swatantra Dev Singh over the past several years. The party’s national vice-president Rekha Verma, a MP from Dhaurahra, is also a Kurmi leader. There are at least four ministers in UP government from the Kurmi community. Also, six-term MP from Maharajganj Pankaj Chaudhary is a Union minister.\n",
      "“In 2022 UP Assembly polls, BJP had given tickets to more than 36 Kurmi candidates, of whom over 22 had won. That shows that Kurmis are associated with BJP. With Nitish joining NDA, our Kurmi vote share is going to increase,” said a BJP leader.\n",

      "The whereabouts of Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren was at the centre of a fierce war of words in the state, with the opposition BJP saying he had gone “missing” and putting up posters to that effect, and the ruling JMM hitting back sharply. It was around 2 pm that Soren emerged and attended a meeting with his MLAs in Ranchi. Also present at the meeting was his wife Kalpana Soren.\n",
      "The drama unfolded a day after a team of the Enforcement Directorate visited Soren’s South Delhi residence to question him in an alleged money laundering case, but he was not present there.\n",
      "The ED claims to have seized Rs 36 lakh in cash, a BMW SUV “registered under a benami name”, and documents from the premises. Its team camped there for almost 13 hours.\n",
      "The ED has issued 10 summons to Soren so far — the latest asked him to appear for questioning on January 29 or January 31. He was also questioned on January 20 at his Ranchi residence for seven hours.\n",
      "Soren also chaired another meeting with JMM and ally Congress legislators in the evening. Sources said 35 MLAs attended the meeting. A legislator who was present said, “All MLAs entrusted their faith in the CM and said they will stand by whatever decisions he takes.”\n",
      "Those who were present also said they discussed what could happen in case Soren is arrested. According to sources, there was no consensus on whether his wife should step into his shoes since other members of his family could object. “We discussed several permutations and combinations,” said an MLA.\n",
      "In an email to the agency on Sunday, Soren agreed to record his statement on January 31 at 1 pm at his residence. He had said the agency’s insistence on recording a statement on or before January 31 “reveals political agenda” to disrupt the functioning of the state government and prevent an elected representative from discharging his official duties. He wrote that most of the questions the ED had were “inaccuracies” in affidavits filed by him with the Election Commission and only three or four questions were related to the plot of land in Bargai area “wrongfully alleged to be owned” by him.\n",
      "Sources in the government said Soren had returned to Jharkhand via road late Monday night.\n",
      "On Tuesday, hitting out at the BJP, the JMM said the CM had some work in Delhi following which he returned. “The CM is an institution, not a person. BJP has maligned him. He has been defamed. We will file a criminal case against the BJP chief and MPs who tweeted photos of Hemant Soren with Rs 11,000 prize money. My party will spend Rs 11 lakh on a psychiatrist who will find out what is happening with BJP’s Babulal Marandi.”\n",
      "Marandi had led the attack on Soren through the day. “The Chief Minister of our state has been missing for the last 40 hours due to fear of the central agencies and has again run away, hiding his face,” he had posted on X.\n",
      "Asked about the ED claiming it found cash at Soren’s Delhi residence, JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said, “ED reaches before time at the CM’s residence… Has the money been planted by Marandi? Openly, hooliganism is being promoted.”\n",
      "After a brief meeting with the MLAs in the afternoon, Soren paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi. Asked by reporters on his whereabouts, he said: “I was in your hearts.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Ranchi district administration issued prohibitory orders around 100 metres of Soren’s residence, the Raj Bhavan and the office of the Enforcement Directorate.\n",

      "All eyes are now on the Mahagathbandhan event in Purnea Tuesday, where the Opposition INDIA bloc hopes to put up a show of strength and unity, with Congress president Mallikarjun Khagre, CPI(ML) leader Dipankar Bhattacharya and several RJD and Left leaders expected to join the Yatra rally.\n",
      "Bihar Congress president Akhilesh Singh said, “The rally will be a show of strength. The ground has a capacity for 1.5-2 lakh people, but we expect a larger turnout tomorrow. We went house-to-house and invited people to attend this rally, and they have been asking us to provide transport so that they can participate.”\n",
      "It is still unclear if RJD chief Lalu Prasad or his son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, the former Bihar deputy chief minister, will be present at the rally. Singh said, “I had a talk with Lalu ji. He and Tejashwi expressed eagerness to participate in the rally. Both have pending notices from the ED and the CBI, though Lalu ji has promised to attend with his son if he manages the time. However, even if he fails to come, he has assured that his representative will be there.”\n",
      "On Monday, the Yatra was greeted by a large number of people lining the route with huge party flags and festoons, eager to catch a glimpse of Rahul, as it reached Kishangunj at around 11 am. As the Yatra bus wound its way to the rally ground, many clicked Rahul’s pictures on the bus with their cell phones while raising slogans in his support.\n",
      "Rahul proceeded to address the meeting at the border town’s Ashfaqullah Stadium, where Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury symbolically handed over the Yatra flag to Bihar party unit chief Akhilesh Singh.\n",
      "Highlighting the launch of his Yatra from Manipur and criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rahul said, “Manipur is burning. People were killed, their houses burnt down, but our PM hasn’t visited Manipur till date. This is the situation in our country.”\n",
      "He then made a strong pitch for a nationwide caste census, weaving it into his nyay (justice) theme. He said, “No one understands “samajik nyay (social justice)” better than Bihar. This country should know how many OBC, SC or ST people there are, for which a caste census is necessary. That will give every group an idea of what they deserve.”\n",
      "At his second rally, towards the end of the day at Araria’s Chandni Chowk, Rahul repeated the demand, saying “The first step of samajik nyay is a caste census. We have to first know how many backward castes, Adivasis and Dalits there are. That’s actually the country’s X-ray. That’s when people will know what their rights are. This is what Congress promises to do.”\n",
      "Rahul’s silence on the JD(U) chief’s jumping ship did not restrain other Congress leaders like Jairam Ramesh and Akhilesh Singh, who attacked Nitish scathingly. Ramesh said at a press conference: “His exit will have no effect on INDIA. But my question is, what will happen to the caste census, which Nitish ji has been demanding for days? Will the BJP react to it?”\n",
      "Ramesh also charged, “This (Nitish’s switch) is part of BJP’s tactics to distract attention from the Nyay Yatra from the very first day. They did it with Milind Deora’s defection earlier, and are now doing the same with Nitish Kumar, but it won’t affect the Yatra.”\n",
      "The Bihar Congress chief said, “We have no problems with whoever wants to leave. I can assure Rahul ji that even after Nitish’s exit, Bihar’s Mahagathbandhan (RJD, Congress and Left) alliance will win two-thirds of the seats in the Lok Sabha.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, talking to media persons, Ramesh said, “Vishwasghat karne mein visheshagya hain (Nitish Kumar is an expert at backstabbing). He changes his political colours like a chameleon… The entire drama was manufactured by the BJP, Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah. However, it will not affect the INDIA bloc.”\n",
      "Referring to the TMC’s move to rule out seat-sharing with the INDIA allies in Bengal, Ramesh said, “Mamata Banerjee says she is with INDIA. She also says she will fight the BJP and the RSS alone on all 42 seats of West Bengal. We haven’t closed any doors. Our door is open, any type of dialogue is welcome.”\n",
      "In Bengal, though, the INDIA alliance situation remained tense, as TMC national general secretary and Mamata’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee came down heavily on the Congress and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, while elaborating on his party’s stance vis-a-vis the INDIA bloc.\n",
      "Speaking to reporters in Diamond Harbour, his Lok Sabha constituency, Abhishek said, “There is a limit to our patience. In the last six months, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has only demanded President’s Rule in West Bengal. As the Congress Lok Sabha leader and PCC chief, he is challenging the TMC chairperson, while the Congress claims TMC is their most important ally. How many times have they criticised the BJP or supported us on issues we are fighting against the central government.”\n",
      "The TMC leader added, “He (Adhir) says ED and CBI are doing good when they raid a TMC leader, and bad when it is done elsewhere. Our stand is clear — the ED and CBI are working in alliance with the BJP. We don’t see any raids on BJP-ruled states, only in states where they are not in power, to harass the Opposition.”\n",

      "Page 2, Article 13\n",
      "AS THE POLL bells toll, the talk of implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act has started getting louder.\n",
      "On Monday, Union minister Shantanu Thakur said the CAA, which was passed by Parliament in December 2019 but whose rules are still to be framed, would be implemented across the country in the next seven days.\n",
      "A short while later, senior BJP Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari said the CAA would be implemented by February.\n",
      "Thakur, the MoS (Shipping), belongs to the Matua community in West Bengal that would be among those to benefit from the CAA. The amendment, which promises speedy citizenship to immigrants from neighbouring countries which are minorities there (effectively leaving out only Muslims), can swing votes in Bengal, which houses a large number of migrants from Bangladesh, including the Matuas.\n",
      "The implementation of the CAA has been one of the prominent poll promises of the BJP in Bengal.\n",
      "Thakur first said that the long-stalled CAA was on its way while addressing a public meeting at Kakdwip in South 24 Parganas on Sunday evening.\n",
      "The statements of Thakur and Adhikari followed a similar commitment by Union Home Minister Amit Shah a month ago. On December 26, addressing a gathering of party workers in Bengal, Shah had said: “Didi (Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee) often misleads our refugee brothers regarding the CAA. Let me make it clear that the CAA is the law of the land, and no one can stop it. Everybody is going to get citizenship. This is our party’s commitment.”\n",
      "However, it is not the first time that the BJP has given this assurance, particularly ahead of elections, even as the Centre has availed nine extensions so far for framing of rules of the law, with the latest one set to expire in March.\n",
      "Asked if there was now a deadline for framing of the rules, Union Home Ministry officials refused to comment.\n",
      "Given that the CAA seemed to leave out only Muslim refugees from its ambit – while mentioning Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan – there had been protests across the country when the Act was passed.\n",
      "The government’s promise to compile a National Register of Citizens (NRC) was seen as an extension of this, in its “anti-Muslim” design. In fact, before the CAA was passed, Shah constantly said at rallies and press conferences that a nationwide NRC would follow the CAA, with his now famous quote: “Aap chronology samajhiye (Understand the sequence).”\n",
      "The Modi government’s dragging of its feet on the implementation of one of the most polarising pieces of legislation brought by it was attributed to several reasons, including the vociferous protests against it. The fiercest of these were in BJP-ruled Assam and Tripura, where even the Hindu community protested against the legislation as they saw it as legitimising the influx of Bangladeshi migrants.\n",
      "The CAA is also seen in Assam as a violation of the 1985 Assam Accord, which stipulated that only those foreigners who had come into the state before March 24, 1971, would be included as citizens. The CAA, in contrast, set the cut-off date for citizenship at December 31, 2014. It was also seen as contrary to the whole process of NRC enumeration in Assam, which was carried out for the precise purpose of weeding out illegal immigrants.\n",
      "Tripura has seen its character change from a tribal-dominated state to one where Bengalis (most of them migrants) are now a majority.\n",
      "The protests had spread beyond the Northeast to other parts of the country as well, with one such demonstration in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, with women at the forefront, lasting over 100 days. In the crackdown by the authorities, dozens of people had been killed in police firing.\n",
      "The tensions built over the protests ultimately culminated in the Delhi riots of February 2020. It was only after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020 that the protests ended.\n",
      "However, ahead of elections, especially in West Bengal and Assam, the BJP routinely brings up the CAA. In February 2021, Home Minister Amit Shah said that the CAA would be implemented after the vaccination drive for Covid was over in the country. This was repeated by Adhikari in August 2022, with a slight modification. In July last year, Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said the CAA would be implemented before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.\n",
      "A month before that, Bengal BJP MLA Asim Sarkar called for the implementation of CAA, expressing concern that, if not done, the party’s support among refugees in the state would get eroded.\n",

      "The first of the Congress-DMK seat-sharing talks held at the DMK headquarters in Chennai on Sunday reaffirmed the partnership between the two allies, coming as positive news for the INDIA bloc after blows from the exit of the Janata Dal (United), and issues with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\n",
      "In the negotiations, senior Congress and DMK leaders are learnt to have agreed on 9 seats for the former, which is also the number of seats the party contested in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.\n",
      "Last time, the Congress had won eight of the nine seats it contested and lost only in Theni, which had gone to the AIADMK. Congress ally DMK had won all the 20 seats it had contested from. The Congress had a 12.6% vote share, while the DMK polled 33.5% of the votes.\n",
      "In all, the alliance led by the DMK in the state, which comprises the Congress, CPM, CPI, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and other smaller parties in Tamil Nadu, had won 38 of the 39 seats in the state.\n",
      "On Sunday, a team of Congress leaders, headed by Congress general secretary Mukul Wasnik, who is the convenor of the National Alliance Committee (NAC), former Union minister Salman Khurshid and Congress Tamil Nadu chief K S Alaigiri, held the talks with the DMK side, which was represented by party MP T R Baalu.\n",
      "After the talks, Wasnik said that “like-minded parties will move together and once again earn the confidence of the people of Tamil Nadu”.\n",
      "This alliance, Wasnik said, “is crucial to combat divisive forces and safeguard democracy”.\n",
      "The Congress demand for nine seats mirrors its previous election strategy of focusing on constituencies in the southern part of the state, which include Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Virudhunagar, Sivaganga, Arani, Tiruvallur or Kanchipuram, Trichy, Karur.\n",
      "DMK sources said that while nine seats were “guaranteed” for the Congress, “adjustments in the constituencies were possible”. Sources also hinted that at least three seats may be swapped, potentially Krishnagiri, Trichy, and Tiruvallur, from the Congress kitty.\n",
      "“The Congress may be offered Thanjavur or Mayiladuthurai, depending on its comfort. We would be contesting about 24 (out of 39) seats in the final list,” a DMK leader said.\n",
      "The DMK is yet to commence talks with its other alliance partners. The party’s coordination and manifesto committees have been actively engaging with district-level functionaries to gather information for the forthcoming polls.\n",
      "In the seat-sharing talks to be held in the coming weeks, the DMK could allocate two seats each to the CPI and CPI(M). Similarly, two seats are expected for the VCK led by VCK. The MDMK led by Vaiko, Kamal Hassan’s Makkal Needi Maim, and the Kongunadu Munnetra Kazhagam, are likely to secure a seat each.\n",

      "The BJP’s decisive Assembly election victories in three Hindi heartland states in December and the change in political equations in Bihar on Sunday notwithstanding, the composition of the Rajya Sabha, where the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is still short of the halfway mark, may not change significantly after the biennial elections next month.\n",
      "The Election Commission on Monday announced that elections to 56 Rajya Sabha seats from 15 states, which are falling vacant in April, will be held on February 27. While 50 members retire on April 2, six will retire the following day. Of the 238 members of the Upper House at present, 109 are from NDA parties while 89 belong to parties in the INDIA alliance.\n",
      "Among the MPs whose term is ending are BJP president J P Nadda; former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh; Union Ministers Bhupender Yadav, Ashwini Vaishnaw, Mansukh Mandaviya, V Muraleedharan, and Narayan Rane; BJP chief spokesperson Anil Baluni; and Samajwadi Party MP and actor Jaya Bachchan.\n",
      "Of the 56 MPs who are retiring, 28 are from the BJP and 10 are from the Congress. The BJP is likely to retain almost the same number of seats while the Congress will win nine seats and can hope to get one more with the help of its allies in Bihar. The Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) will be the biggest loser. Three of its MPs are retiring and the Congress which ousted the BRS from power in Telangana last month is set to pick up two of the seats.\n",
      "Uttar Pradesh will have the highest number of vacancies with 10 seats, followed by Maharashtra and Bihar (six each), Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal (five each), Karnataka and Gujarat (four each), Odisha, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Rajasthan (three), and Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Chhattisgarh (one each).\n",
      "Among the 10 members retiring in UP, nine are from the BJP but it is expected to win seven. The Samajwadi Party (SP), which improved its tally to 111 in 2022 from 47 in 2017, will pick the remaining three. But the BJP will gain a seat in Bihar. Of the six retiring, two each are from the JD(U) and the RJD and one each from the BJP and the Congress. Given the present strength of the Assembly, the BJP and the RJD will get two seats each and the JD(U) one. The RJD-led Opposition has the numbers to get the sixth seat, which the Congress is vying for.\n",
      "The other interesting electoral battle will be in Maharashtra where the NCP and the Shiv Sena have split since the last Assembly elections. Based on the current strength, the ruling Mahayuti coalition of the BJP, Shiv Sena led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, and NCP led by Ajit Pawar, is likely to stake claim to five out of the six seats while the Congress is eyeing a comfortable victory from the sixth seat.\n",
      "Among those retiring from Maharashtra are Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan, Union MSME Minister Narayan Rane and former Union Minister Prakash Javadekar besides the Congress’s Kumar Ketkar, Sharad Pawar-affiliated NCP member Vandana Chavan, and Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) member Anil Desai.\n",
      "The outcome will be more or less the same in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh, the three heartland states which the BJP won in December. Among the five retiring members in Madhya Pradesh, four are from the BJP and one from the Congress. Based on the current strength of the two parties, the outcome is likely to remain the same. In Rajasthan, two BJP members and one from the Congress are retiring. And the parties have the strength to elect the same number of MPs. In Chhattisgarh, a BJP member is retiring and the party will get back the seat.\n",
      "The Congress will lose seats in Gujarat. Of the four members who are retiring, two each are from the BJP and the Congress. All four will now go to the BJP. In Odisha, two of the retiring members are from the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and one is from the BJP. All three will now go to the BJD. The BJP will retain the lone seats falling vacant in Uttarakhand and Haryana, while the Congress will win the one seat in Himachal Pradesh from where J P Nadda is set to retire.\n",
      "In Karnataka, three MPs from the Congress and one from the BJP are retiring and the outcome after the elections will be the same. Another interesting change will be in Andhra Pradesh. A member each from the BJP, the TDP, and the ruling YSRCP are retiring. Based on the current strength, all three seats will go to the YSRCP.\n",
      "The elections will be interesting in West Bengal, where all is not well between INDIA allies Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Congress. Of the five seats getting vacant, four are currently held by the TMC and one by the Congress. Based on the current strength, the TMC can get four again and the fifth seat will go to the BJP.\n",
      "The retiring Congress MP is senior lawyer and Congress Working Committee (CWC) member Abhishek Singhvi, who won last time with TMC support. Singhvi has appeared for the Mamata Banerjee government in cases in the Supreme Court.\n",

      "As BJP leaders from across India prepare to gather next month to receive the final blueprint for the party’s Lok Sabha election strategy, the party is confident that the nation’s mood is in its favour.\n",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has solidified his power position by convincing the electorate that he is the only champion of development and Hindutva — especially after the consecration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya — and is the reason for India’s heightened position in the global order. Modi has channelled that sentiment into strengthening his bond with the electorate.\n",
      "But the BJP’s top leaders remember the lessons from the party’s defeat in 2004 — it lost despite few expecting it to — to not take the overall atmosphere for granted as the basis for its poll calculations. They have analysed the political situation in each state and weighed the party’s prospects beyond the outer layer. Many in the party often cite the party’s reliance on the goodwill factor and not going deep into the state combinations as the reasons for the failure of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government to return to power in 2004 despite the “positive atmosphere in favour of the BJP and NDA (National Democratic Alliance)”. A BJP leader said, “The current leadership does not want to repeat that mistake and does not want to take any chance.”\n",
      "While the political developments in Patna last week hinted at the BJP’s approach to key states, party leaders said politics in other swing states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka could witness “stunning instances”. They said that electoral outcomes in Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and West Bengal were crucial and that the leadership was focussing on these states to ensure that the NDA gets as close to the tally of 400 seats as possible. In 2019, all these states contributed 123 states to the alliance’s tally.\n",
      "When the JD(U) walked out of the alliance in August 2022, the NDA lost 17 MPs. With ground surveys indicating a huge loss for the BJP — hinting that the party could end up winning only 24, as well as the JD(U) — its assessment is its tally would not have gone beyond five to six while with the Opposition — it made sense for the two parties to get back together. For the BJP, it was of paramount importance to transform Bihar, a key Hindi heartland state, from a swing state to a stable one and it struck at the opportune moment.\n",
      "BJP leaders argued that more than the surveys, which were conducted before the Ram Temple consecration on January 22, it was the party’s political future in the state that helped PM Modi decide in favour of the BJP and JD(U) getting back together. BJP sources said it was Modi who took the initiative and spoke to Nitish Kumar, inviting him back to the NDA. The BJP leadership assessed that the JD(U) with its around 15% vote base in Bihar could disintegrate post-Nitish Kumar and if the BJP did not keep the party close, the RJD could take over at least a large portion of its support base once Kumar’s leadership ends. This would have made the RJD stronger, posing a serious threat to the BJP in the 2025 Assembly elections. “This is a long-term plan while breaking of the INDIA bloc could be the immediate outcome. When the chief leader who went around to unite the Opposition leaves that platform, the entire platform looks ridiculous,” said a senior BJP leader in Bihar.\n",
      "BJP leaders said the end of the INDIA bloc would percolate into a political situation in other states too, including Uttar Pradesh, where the party is now eyeing at least 10-15 seats to its current tally of 62 (the NDA’s current position there is 66 in the Lok Sabha, while the BSP has 10 MPs, the SP three, and the Congress one).\n",
      "The BJP is also into hectic parleys in Karnataka, where the party won 25 of 28 seats in the Lok Sabha in 2019 to consolidate its position that has faced disintegration with the spectacular win of the Congress in last year’s Assembly polls. The party, currently led by B Y Vijayendra, has been in talks to get back those who left the party in the run-up to the state elections. While almost a dozen leaders walked out of the BJP, the party already got the most prominent of them, Jagdish Shettar, back into its fold last week. According to BJP sources, more are set to return to the party even as the party tries to induct some Congress leaders too.\n",
      "Although the BJP has earned the upper hand in the optics in Maharashtra by bringing in Eknath Shinde and breaking the Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), there is “hunger” for more. “The continuing disintegration of the Congress could throw more opportunities for the BJP in several states and Maharashtra is one of them. There could be many surprises from the state ahead of the Lok Sabha polls,” said a BJP leader involved in the state unit’s affairs, adding that several prominent faces could join the party in the coming days.\n",

      "A day after JD(U) supremo Nitish Kumar walked out of the Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) to rejoin the BJP-led NDA and become the Chief Minister for the ninth time, RJD national vice president and veteran socialist leader Shivanand Tiwari speaks to The Indian Express on various issues ranging from Nitish’s move and its ramifications for the Opposition camp to RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s political trajectory. Excerpts:\n",
      "What can I say? I cannot imagine. I am shocked, dismayed, surprised and saddened. Having known Nitish all these years and also having played a crucial part in his political journey when I had also walked along with him from Janata Dal in 1993 to form Samata Party, I can safely say that it is not the same person and politician. He was once known for his political acumen. I want to know who had invited him to join Mahagathbandhan in August 2022. I am also a witness to how he, after returning to us in 2022, had apologised to former CM Rabri Devi with folded hands for his 2017 switch to BJP. That time, I was made to believe that he would now stay back and give a right direction to Mandal politics we all championed all these years.\n",
      "Tejashwi has evolved as a very mature leader and I see a great potential in him. While he has drawn heavily from his father Lalu Prasad’s social justice theme, he has very smartly woven development politics into it. He had successfully done it during the 2020 Assembly polls when the RJD had almost come to power on the promise of 10 lakh jobs. After Nitish and Tejashwi got together in 2022, we saw how Tejashwi made Nitish own up his job theme. The same Nitish who had laughed away Tejashwi’s job promise at the Gopalganj rally during 2020 poll campaign ended up distributing appointment letters. Here, Tejashwi has clearly scored over Nitish. No matter Nitish takes out full-page health department advertisement without giving credit to then health minister Tejashwi, everyone knows that Tejashwi has performed very well in his brief 17-month tenure as the Deputy CM.\n",
      "We were very happy when he (Nitish) had raised EBC (Extremely Backward Classes) pitch and how almost all the parties had started vying with each other after Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur had been awarded Bharat Ratna. I was also reminded of how Nitish, Mangani Lal Mandal and I and some others had first talked about making EBC a part of social justice plan in 1992. Now, I wonder how Nitish had returned to socialist camp in 2022 with caste survey theme and had built the right momentum…. He might now get political benefits but his politics has lost all its core values.\n",
      "Tejashwi has clearly said with reference to whether the JD (U) would survive after the 2024 Lok Sabha polls when Nitish’s political utility could be over. As for the RJD, it would work as a responsible party. Tejashwi has made the right comment and it is just a matter of time he starts hitting the ground, spend time with party workers and common people to know the political pulse beyond whatever is being said and published in newspapers, channels and social media.\n",
      "Political calculations have surely gone topsy-turvy. With Nitish with us, we had a clear advantage. But now, it is very tough for Mahagathbandhan and INDIA bloc. If we refer to 2019 poll results, there was a huge gap between NDA and Mahagathbandhan. With Left and Congress, RJD has to cover a lot of ground. This is where we have to be in the field. Tejashwi has done the right thing by trying to own up (government) achievements made under his leadership. We have to keep up the momentum and work around our A to Z (all-community) politics.\n",

The Congress has only two MPs in Bengal (from Malda Dakshin and Berhampur seats, both in the two districts), though neither the Congress nor the Left Front has any MLAs in the state.\n",
      "“We have received an invitation. We will attend the rally in Malda and Murshidabad. While leaders like Sujan Chakraborty will be present in Malda, I will be present in Murshidabad,” said Md Selim, CPI(M) state secretary, to the media.\n",
      "According to CPI(M) sources, the party’s state leaders and especially youth leaders, will be present at the Yatra in a show of solidarity with the Congress, along with Politburo member Selim and Central Committee member Sujan Chakraborty.\n",
      "Sources also stated that DYFI leader and the party’s projected face in the state, Meenakshi Mukherjee, has also been invited and is likely to attend.\n",
      "On Sunday, while Rahul Gandhi covered Siliguri, CPI(M) state secretariat member Jibesh Sarkar was seen with party workers joining the rally.\n",
      "“We had always supported the Yatra. We had also made it clear that we can’t be there if the TMC is around. Now that the TMC has not only distanced itself from the Yatra, but is indirectly trying to disturb its progress — we saw some people displaying posters against the Congress in Coochbehar — our leaders and workers will be there in Malda and Murshidabad in a show of unity,” said a senior CPI(M) leader.\n",
      "According to political observers, though, the show of strength in Malda and Murshidabad — the state’s two minority-dominated districts — is essential to the electoral prospects of both the Congress and the CPI(M), since both parties are trying to woo minority voters back to their fold.\n",
      "The two parties have had an on-and-off electoral alliance in the past, which includes the 2016 and 2021 Assembly polls. However, early into INDIA bloc talks, the CPI(M) had made it clear that it would not go with the TMC in Bengal. Accordingly, before the Yatra entered Bengal, the Left party told the Congress leadership that it would not be able to participate in case the TMC leadership was seen at the rally. Their hesitation quickly changed after TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee on January 24 announced that her party will go it alone in Bengal, and only take a call on any national alliance after the Lok Sabha polls.\n",
      "Though the Congress has kept its door open for the TMC, as it pushes for a broad anti-BJP front, Mamata is yet to react to their overtures. In fact, the Chief Minister will be in North Bengal to attend state government programmes, while Rahul’s Yatra enters Malda.\n",

      "At 52% of the population, OBCs are a decisive force in Maharashtra. Comprising 250-plus groups and sub-groups, they have a presence across 355 talukas covering 36 districts, with not a single one of the state’s 40,000-plus villages not having some numbers.\n",
      "The Marathas, in contrast, are 33% of the state population, but the single largest group in the state, and socially and politically the most dominant.\n",
      "Since the late 1980s, led by right-wing ideologue Vasantrao Bhagwat, the BJP has assiduously nurtured an OBC support base, to expand beyond its image of being a Brahmin-Baniya party. Bhagwat’s efforts ensured that backward communities such as the Malis, Dhangars and Vanjaris – popularly grouped under the acronym ‘Madhav’ – emerged as the mainstay of the BJP.\n",
      "In contrast, the Marathas are seen as traditionally supporters of the Congress, and later its offshoot NCP, plus the Shiv Sena.\n",
      "While the Maharashtra government, headed by Maratha leader Eknath Shinde and including another Maratha as Deputy CM (Ajit Pawar), apart from Devendra Fadnavis, has tried to assuage the OBCs calling their apprehensions about dilution of their quota as misplaced, they have had little success so far.\n",
      "Fadnavis, a Brahmin leader, also reiterated Monday that the government was committed to safeguarding the OBC quota, with “Kunbi certificates to be issued only to eligible candidates after thorough scrutiny”.\n",
      "But the BJP’s fear additionally is that the gains of the Maratha quota move will accrue to Shinde as CM, consolidating his base, while the OBC anger will boomerang on the BJP.\n",
      "A senior BJP OBC leader from North Maharashtra admitted the party was worried about the optics. “Marathas are a dominant community. When they get Kunbi certificates, they will automatically avail the OBC quota… While those in the know argue that the number of individuals getting new Kunbi certificates as per the notification will be small, the question is how will we counter OBC opposition, ” the leader said.\n",
      "Treading with caution, the Shinde Sena-BJP-Ajit Pawar NCP government has told its members not to speak out of turn, given the risk of aggravating an already delicate situation. And yet Union minister Narayan Rane, himself a Maratha, has gone public against the draft notification. “Extending OBC rights to Marathas, rather than separate reservation, was not a good decision. It will further divide the society and generate unrest,” he said.\n",
      "Rane believes the backwards within the Maratha community should get separate reservation in government jobs and education, and fears a dilution of the Maratha identity if it accepts Kunbi certificates for OBC status.\n",
      "In 2013-14, as Cabinet minister in the Prithviraj Chavan-led Congress-NCP coalition government, Rane had steered a committee that recommended a separate 16% quota for Marathas. However, it was challenged in courts.\n",
      "The Maratha issue has hit the BJP at a time when the party was hoping to steady its ship in Maharashtra on the strength of the Ram Temple consecration boost.– against the challenge posed by the Uddhav Sena-Sharad Pawar NCP-Congress alliance, that is so far holding strong.\n",
      "Trying to find the middle ground, the BJP let Shinde solely take the limelight for warding off the immediate challenge posed by Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil’s planned Mumbai protest. However, the BJP knows that it needs to do more to assuage the OBCs.\n",
      "Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi president Prakash Ambedkar, who has carved out a Dalit-OBC vote base for himself and has so far kept his options open between the NDA and Maha Vikas Aghadi, underlines the BJP’s dilemma.\n",
      "“CM Eknath Shinde has become the tallest Maratha leader of Maharashtra. He has surpassed Sharad Pawar, Ashok Chavan et al. So, the Maratha vote bank will go to the Shiv Sena (Shinde faction),” Ambedkar predicts.\n",

      "A spate of “courtesy visits” by Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) MLAs with Telangana CM Revanth Reddy over the past week has sparked a buzz in the state about the Congress attempting to poach the Opposition party’s MLAs.\n",
      "The latest meeting came on Sunday when Rajendranagar MLA Prakash Goud met the CM. His photo sporting the Congress’s khanduva (scarf) gave a boost to the speculation first triggered on January 23 when MLAs Sunita Lakshma Reddy (Narsapur), K Prabhakar Reddy (Dubbak), G Mahipal Reddy (Patancheru) and Manik Rao (Zaheerabad), all from the erstwhile Medak district, met Revanth.\n",
      "BRS MLA Prakash Goud (Rajendra Nagar) met with Chief Minister @revanth_anumula Garu at his residence. pic.twitter.com/tADeD42uyc\n",
      "— Sama Ram Mohan Reddy (@RamMohanINC) January 28, 2024\n",
      "The MLAs have categorically denied any such move and said they met the CM to discuss issues related to their constituencies. “It is our right to inform the Chief Minister about the problems and development of the constituencies. We have no intention of changing parties. We did not negotiate with anyone. Our meeting with the CM was to explain the problems of Medak district. Some people are trying to create negative propaganda but our senior leaders have complete confidence in us. We will be with KCR till our last breath,” said Prabhakar Reddy.\n",
      "The Dubbak MLA, who defeated the BJP’s Raghunandan Rao in the recent Assembly elections, led the delegation of four MLAs and submitted a memorandum regarding protocol discrepancies in his constituency. The other three legislators, sources said, did not submit any memoranda to the CM.\n",
      "Congress insiders said Prabhakar Reddy had called upon the CM as he was keen on contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Medak and his chances of getting the BRS ticket were slim as party chief and former CM K Chandrashekar Rao, popularly known as KCR, was also eyeing the seat. In the run-up to the Assembly polls, Prabhakar Reddy who was then the Medak MP was stabbed by a man during campaigning, eliciting a strong response from Revanth who condemned the attack and demanded a fair inquiry.\n",
      "“They have expressed interest in joining (the Congress) but right now we are not keen. We will wait and watch and the high command will take a decision closer to the Lok Sabha elections,” said a former Telangana Congress spokesperson. Some Congress insiders have dubbed the attempt to bring over BRS MLAs “Operation Akarsh”.\n",
      "The meetings assume significance as the Congress wants to improve its position in the state’s urban areas and check both the BRS and the BJP. In last year’s Assembly elections, the Congress swept to power winning 64 of the 119 seats. While the party did exceedingly well in the rural areas, the BRS won most of its 39 seats from the Hyderabad and Rangareddy regions.\n",
      "The Congress also has its eyes on the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls scheduled for 2025. In the last civic polls in 2020, the BJP put up an impressive performance in the civic elections and emerged as the second-largest party by winning 48 of the 150 wards. The BJP is seen as having an influence in urban pockets of the state such as Hyderabad, Nizamabad, Kamareddy, Mahbubnagar, and parts of Adilabad. The party, despite seeming to have lost steam in the run-up to the Assembly polls, won eight seats, a majority of which are in semi-urban or urban areas.\n",
      "A Congress leader said now that the party was in power it wanted to consolidate its base among urban voters and would leave no stone unturned to achieve it. “We have done exceedingly well in rural areas. Now that the government has cancelled the extension of 54 corporation chairpersons, we want to make our presence felt in urban areas and make up lost ground,” he said.\n",
      "Apart from Hyderabad and surrounding areas, the Congress’s attempts to secure urban voters have been on display in other parts of the state too. Earlier this month, Nalgonda civic chief M Saidi Reddy of the BRS lost the no-trust motion after a handful of councillors switched over to the Congress.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the BRS is wary of these “courtesy visits” of its MLAs. A party insider seen as close to former minister and KCR’s son K T Rama Rao said these visits were purely about the issues of the MLAs’ constituencies. “However, we are aware that the Congress, which did not fare well in the urban belt, especially in and around Hyderabad, is looking to strengthen its base in these areas ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. We are confident that we will win the maximum number of Lok Sabha seats in the state,” he said.\n",
      "After the 2018 Assembly polls, 12 of the 19 Congress MLAs had switched over to the BRS that was then the Telangana Rashtra Samithi.\n",

      "Page 2, Article 23\n",
      "Amid the tumult in the INDIA bloc, with the JD(U) walking out in Bihar and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ruling out alliances in West Bengal and Punjab, respectively, the Samajwadi Party (SP) sprang a surprise when its chief Akhilesh Yadav apparently unilaterally announced Saturday that the party would give the Congress 11 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh.\n",
      "Sources in the Congress said the party was still hoping for 15-16 seats.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the SP has also stitched a deal with its ally and another INDIA partner, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), giving it 7 Lok Sabha seats in its stronghold of western UP.\n",
      "The INDIA bloc’s seat-sharing negotiations for UP have so far been difficult, made tougher by the fact that the three between them won just a handful of seats due to the BJP’s dominant performance both in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections.\n",
      "In 2019, when the SP had an alliance with the BSP and RLD, the Akhilesh Yadav-led party had won 5 seats, the Congress just 1 (Rae Bareli, with even Rahul Gandhi losing from Amethi), and the RLD none. In 2014, the Congress, in alliance with the RLD, had won just 2 seats and the RLD did not win any. The SP had won 5 seats then.\n",
      "This time, among the seats the SP has ceded to the Congress are its bastions of Amethi and Rae Bareli. Reports suggest the other seats the Congress may contest include Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bareilly, Jhansi, Kanpur, Varanasi and Sultanpur.\n",
      "The SP has reportedly demanded, in turn, one seat in Madhya Pradesh as part of INDIA – either Khajuraho or Tikamgarh, both seats the BJP had won comfortably in 2019 and 2014, with the Congress finishing a distant second and the SP third or fourth.\n",
      "The nine of the 11 seats the SP has reportedly offered to the Congress were also won by the BJP in 2019, with the Congress coming second in only 3 (including Amethi) and third in 6. In fact, it was the SP that had finished as the runner-up in 4 of these seats and the BSP in 2 seats.\n",
      "In 2014, of the 9 seats the SP reportedly wants to leave for Congress, Rahul and Sonia had won Amethi and Rae Bareli, respectively, but the BJP had won the rest.\n",
      "The 2009 polls were far better for the INDIA parties – the Congress had won 21 seats and the SP 23. But the political landscape in UP has changed considerably since then.\n",
      "At the first seat-sharing meeting between the Congress and SP held earlier this month, the parties had agreed that the performance in the 2022 Assembly elections would form the basis of the seat-sharing formula for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.\n",
      "If one goes by that, the BJP was the clear winner, with 255 of the 403 seats and 41.3% of the vote share. With its NDA allies, it won a total 273 seats and 43.3% of the vote share. The SP was the second largest party with 111 seats and 32.1% of the vote share, with its ally RLD winning 9 seats from 2.85% of the vote. The Congress, which contested 399 seats, won just 2 and 2.3% of the vote.\n",
      "If the 2022 Assembly polls were extrapolated in terms of the 80 Lok Sabha seats, each of which comprises five to six Assembly segments, the INDIA allies came out ahead of the NDA in only 23 seats, of which the SP had the lead in 20 on its own strength. The Congress’s votes made a difference in only 3 seats.\n",
      "In fact, the party got more than a lakh votes in just 4 parliamentary constituencies and more than 50,000 votes in just 10 seats.\n",
      "Going by the 2022 polls, in the 9 known seats of the 11 being offered by the SP to the Congress, the BJP was the leading party in all but one seat – Rae Bareli. In 8 of these seats, the SP was the runner-up. The Congress’s best showing was in Amethi, Rae Bareli and Kanpur, though it still trailed the BJP and SP in terms of votes. In the other seats, the Congress secured fewer votes than even the BSP.\n",
      "The INDIA bloc’s combined vote share was higher than the NDA’s in just 2 of these seats.\n",
      "Going by these numbers, the SP can claim the lion’s share of the Lok Sabha seats in the upcoming polls.\n",
      "The 2022 Assembly polls also showed that the Congress stands to gain immensely if the SP’s vote transfers to it in many of the seats. The converse, however, won’t be true, given the low number of votes the Congress won in 2022.\n",
      "There is, of course, the BSP factor – the party has refused to join the INDIA bloc and is likely to go it alone. Though the BSP’s influence has shrunk considerably in recent years, it still wins a considerable chunk of votes in the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. It won 19.4% and 19.8% of the vote share in the 2019 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, respectively. In the 2022 Assembly polls, its vote share fell to 13% from 22.4% in 2017 and 25.9% in 2012.\n",
      "Though the BSP remains unlikely to join the INDIA bloc, as an exercise, if its votes were added to the INDIA bloc’s tallies in the 2022 Assembly polls, it could make a big difference in challenging the NDA. Combining the votes of the BSP with the SP, the Congress and RLD, the grouping outperforms the NDA in 53 seats, assuming the votes transfer across parties. The BSP on its own though is not the biggest party in terms of votes in any seat.\n",
      "However, what will weigh on INDIA’s mind – and the Congress has been trying its best to get the BSP to its side – is that in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BSP had won 10 seats outperforming both the SP and Congress.\n",

      "Page 2, Article 24\n",
      "The return of former chief minister and six-time MLA Jagadish Shettar, 68, to the BJP fold following a nine-month stint with the Congress has come as a shot in the arm to the BJP in the Lingayat belt in northern Karnataka ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.\n",
      "BJP sources said Shettar, who belongs to the Lingayat community, has been “guaranteed” a Lok Sabha poll ticket by the BJP top brass while reinducting him into the party.\n",
      "Shettar is likely to be the BJP’s candidate for the Belagavi parliamentary seat where the party does not have a strong candidate since the death of its four-time MP Suresh Angadi in 2020. He could also be fielded from Dharwad or Haveri.\n",
      "“There has been an assurance that Shettar will be fielded by the party in the Lok Sabha polls. The seat was not discussed but the state leadership is keen on fielding him from Belagavi,” said BJP sources.\n",
      "After rejoining the BJP on January 25, Shettar had claimed that he was doing it without any conditions. “The issues before the country is unity, protection of the country and development and PM Modi has been working over the last decade to strengthen the country and our wish is that he should be PM again and that the BJP must become stronger,” he had then said.\n",
      "Shettar’s return would however facilitate the BJP’s search for strong candidates in some key Lingayat-dominated constituencies in north Karnataka.\n",
      "Following the demise of Suresh Angadi, the BJP fielded his wife Mangala Angadi in the Belagavi bypoll in 2021. She managed to win the seat with a slim margin of 5240 votes, beating local Congress strongman Sathish Jarkiholi, a Scheduled Tribe leader, due to the sympathy factor. However, the loss of ground by the BJP in Belagavi with the deaths of other local Lingayat leaders like Umesh Katti and Anand Mamani, coupled with the exit of the party’s ex-deputy CM Laxman Savadi to the Congress, had put the BJP on a shaky wicket in the Lingayat-dominated region in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls.\n",
      "Shettar’s return is expected to strengthen the BJP’s chances in Belagavi, although he hails from the neighbouring Hubbali region.\n",
      "Shettar’s son Sankalp Shettar is married to late Suresh Angadi and current MP Mangala Angadi’s daughter Shradha Angadi. Shettar’s return to the BJP has given the BJP the option of fielding him or his daughter-in-law Shradha Angadi in Belagavi.\n",
      "With the Congress considering Jarkiholi’s candidature from the seat again, there are, however, concerns in the BJP that a “sympathy wave” for him for his 2021 loss may help the former wrest the seat from it after two decades.\n",
      "According to BJP sources, Shettar’s return was a result of backdoor efforts by some of his close associates in the party, including ex-minister Shankar Munekoppa, who persuaded him while highlighting his family’s history as part of the RSS and BJP.\n",
      "Subsequently, ex-CM and Lingayat veteran B S Yediyurappa and his son B Y Vijayendra, the state BJP president, reached out to him.\n",
      "“Over the last eight to nine months the BJP workers and the state MLAs and ex-MLAS and leaders wanted me to return to the BJP. The national leaders also said that I should return,” Shettar said while rejoining the BJP.\n",
      "“Initially, Shettar’s condition was that he should be allowed to contest the Dharwad seat by the BJP. He was told that he should not pose any pre-conditions and that the decision for contesting the Lok Sabha polls should be left to the party high command, ” BJP sources said.\n",
      "The Dharwad Lok Sabha seat is currently held by Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, a known rival of Shettar, who has benefited from the latter’s Lingayat support base to win the seat thrice consecutively since 2009.\n",
      "Shettar had obliquely blamed Joshi and BJP national general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh, both Brahmin leaders, for the denial of the BJP ticket to him from the Hubbali-Dharwad Central seat in the May 2023 Assembly polls, which had then led to his switch to the Congress that fielded him from the seat but he lost to the BJP debutant Mahesh Tenginakai.\n",
      "BJP sources said Shettar may contest the Dharwad seat in the event of Joshi switching to a new constituency like Uttar Kannada — where the BJP has an issue with its five-time MP Ananth Kumar Hegde who had been unwell for nearly three years of his current term.\n",
      "Shettar may also be the candidate from the Haveri seat with a sizeable Lingayat population, where the sitting BJP MP Shivakumar Udasi, the son of former BJP minister C M Udasi, has indicated a possible exit from the LS seat to enter the Assembly poll fray on account of his father’s death.\n",
      "The process of Shettar’s return to the BJP resumed following the party high command’s clearance, but it was kept under wraps.\n",
      "BJP sources said his meeting had been scheduled for April 24-25 midnight with Union Home Minister Amit Shah but was cancelled due to the latter’s engagements. A meeting was then held the next morning at 11 am and Shettar’s return was concluded within an hour of the meeting with Shah, sources said.\n",
      "“It is a sign of lack of leaders and desperation of the BJP that they are making efforts to get Shettar to rejoin the BJP,” state Congress president D K Shivakumar said on the eve of Shettar’s move.\n",
      "After Shettar’s return to the BJP, Shivakumar said, “Shettar had joined the Congress after his disillusionment with the internal affairs of the BJP. He had even made big accusations against the BJP. We had accommodated him as an MLC in spite of his loss by 35,000 votes in the Assembly election. Despite BJP trying to establish contact with him for the last 2-3 months, Shettar was determined to stay in the party till a couple of days before.”\n",
      "The BJP is reportedly wooing another key former party leader from Belagavi Laxman Savadi, who had also switched to the Congress ahead of the 2023 Assembly polls after being denied a party ticket. Savadi, who is currently a Congress MLA from Athani, has denied being approached by the BJP.\n",
      "“Savadi is a senior Congress leader and an asset for the party. He said he came on his own to the Congress and he would love to work with the Congress,” Shivakumar said regarding the possibility of Savadi’s exit.\n",
      "The BJP is also considering getting its former minister and mining scam accused G Janardhan Reddy, who is the lone MLA of his Kalyana Rajya Pragathi Paksha party. The party reckons Reddy’s return may benefit its prospects in the Ballari region.\n",

      "Since coming to power, the Bhajan Lal Sharma-led BJP government in Rajasthan has held only one Cabinet meeting. In the meeting on January 18, the government announced it would review the decisions taken in the last six months of the previous Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government. The government set up a ministerial committee that will submit a report to the CM in three months.\n",
      "Additionally, the BJP’s Assembly polls manifesto was also adopted as a policy document. To ensure its execution, an Officer on Special Duty will be appointed to the Chief Minister’s Office.\n",
      "In another decision, pension for detainees during the Emergency – the payment was discontinued in 2019 – will be resumed. The beneficiaries will get Rs 20,000 as pension and Rs 4,000 in medical aid each month.\n",
      "In the meeting, a comprehensive presentation was also made on the 100-day action plan of the state government. A separate presentation was made on the achievements of the government in its first 30 days such as the implementation of the policy to provide LPG at a subsidised price of Rs 450 per cylinder, and the creation of a Special Investigation Team and an Anti-Gangster Task Force to check paper leaks and organised crime, respectively. The Cabinet also noted that between December 16 and January 17, Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra camps and programmes were held at 10,550 locations across the state, with 2.54 crore citizens and 1.77 lakh public representatives registering their presence.\n",
      "The Cabinet also noted that under the Annapurna Rasoi Yojana, the quantity of food has been increased from 450 gm to 600 gm per plate (300 gm chapati, 100 gm lentil, 100 gm vegetables, 100 gm rice/millet khichdi, and pickle). With this, the government subsidy has also been increased from Rs 17 per plate to Rs 22 per plate.\n",
      "Other key decisions include the scrapping of the Rajiv Gandhi Yuva Mitra internship and the Mahatma Gandhi Seva Prerak, as well as pausing the free smartphone scheme for women, saying these schemes need to be examined first.\n",
      "Immediately after taking over the reins in Madhya Pradesh, the Mohan Yadav government disbursed Rs 1,576 crore as part of its Mukhyamantri Ladli Behana Yojana under which a monthly stipend of Rs 1,250 is paid to women from poor families. Officials, though, have so far remained silent on the government’s promise to hike the stipend to Rs 3,000 per month.\n",
      "The government also hiked the procurement price of tendu leaf, a poll promise aimed at the tribal communities, to Rs 4,000 per bag. “With this decision, 35 lakh tendu leaf collectors in the state will get an additional remuneration of approximately Rs 165 crore,” said a government official.\n",
      "Under the Mukhyamantri Ladli Behana Yojana, the BJP has also promised to construct concrete houses for more than 1.3 crore beneficiaries; free education, from kindergarten to post-graduation, for girls from poor families; and a hike in the Ladli Laxmi handout to Rs 2 lakh.\n",
      "The party had also promised free education for students from poor families from Class 1 to 12; Rs 1,200 annual assistance for school bags, books and uniforms; a hike in stipend of up to Rs 10,000 under the Seekho Kamao Yojana; and LPG cylinders at Rs 450 for beneficiaries of the state’s Ladli Behna and the Centre’s Ujjwala yojanas. When asked about these, government officials said that “different government departments are preparing a 100-day roadmap to fulfil the promises made by the BJP”.\n",
      "In a push for tribal welfare under the PM Jan Man Yojana, the government on January 17 approved the construction of multipurpose centres — costing Rs 60 lakh per centre — in districts dominated by Special Backward Tribes (officially categorised as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups or PVTGs).\n",
      "The establishment and operation of 194 new Anganwadi centres in special tribal areas under the “Saksham Anganwadi and Nutrition 2.0” scheme have also been approved.\n",
      "“New centres will be opened in isolated villages of Special Backward Tribe areas whose population is 100 or more, and where there is no Anganwadi centre. Total expenditure will be Rs 15.70 crore,” said an official.\n",
      "Furthermore, the Cabinet has also approved the Malhargarh Lift Irrigation Project on the Betwa river in Mungaoli tehsil of Ashoknagar district. The project, a promise made by local politicians during the Assembly polls, will provide irrigation to 7,500 hectares in 26 villages of Mungawali tehsil and will cost Rs 87.25 crore.\n",
      "The Vishnu Deo Sai government has said it has fulfilled two “Modi guarantees” promised in the BJP’s Assembly election manifesto and is in the process of fulfilling two more.\n",
      "The first of the two promises already fulfilled is approval for 18.12 lakh families under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. They will be provided with funds for the construction of houses. The second promise the government says it has fulfilled is approving the free annual visit of 20,000 people to Ayodhya, UP, for darshan at the Ram Temple.\n",
      "Also in the works is the promise to procure 21 quintals of paddy per farmer at Rs 3,100 per quintal as promised in the manifesto, which is over and above the minimum support price (MSP). The balance amount will be funded by the state government even though it hasn’t made clear when and how it plans to pay it.\n",
      "Similarly, the BJP government is seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into alleged corruption in the Chhattisgarh Public Service Commission (PSC) examination and selection for 2021. That, along with the promise to conduct the PSC exams on par with the standards set by the UPSC exams, was made in the manifesto.\n",
      "The government, in relief for educated unemployed youth, has also announced a five-year relaxation in the maximum age limit for local residents looking to apply for government jobs.

The relaxation in the maximum age limit for other special categories has been kept unchanged. Including all other relaxations, the maximum age limit will remain fixed at 45 years. This relaxation will not apply to the Home (Police) department.”\n",
      "The Congress government led by Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy has begun implementing two of its six poll promises and is working on introducing a third guarantee from the second week of February. The Cabinet, in its first meeting on December 7, approved the implementation of all six guarantees in the party’s poll manifesto within 100 days.\n",
      "The first guarantee launched by the government was the free “Mahalaxmi Scheme” bus service for women. As per orders issued on December 8 by the transport department, women of all ages and transgender people can access state transport services free of cost in the Palle Velugu and Express categories of buses run by the state road transport corporation by producing an ID card proving they are locals. Under the Mahalaxmi Scheme, eligible women have also started receiving monthly financial assistance of Rs 2,500.

      "On January 23, Roads and Buildings Minister Komatireddy Venkat Reddy said the government would roll out the Gruha Jyothi Scheme to provide up to 200 units of free electricity to eligible consumers from the second week of February. He said the government would have implemented it in January itself but for the losses run up by the previous Bharat Rashtra Samithi government in the Telangana State Transco and Genco, the state-run electricity utilities. The Congress government had to stabilise the situation before planning the scheme’s implementation, the minister said.\n",

Gram Sabhas are being held to register beneficiaries and tenant farmers who will receive Rs 12,000 per acre.
